what is chimerical and false; it is not a piece of buffoonery so much as a critical exposition. What do we parody but the absurdities
of writers, who frequently make their heroes act against nature, common-sense, and truth? After all, it is the public, not we, who are
the authors of these Parodies.”</p>

<p>A lady of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas bleu</i> celebrity (the term is getting odious, particularly
to our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savantes</i>) had two friends, whom she equally admired&mdash;an
elegant poet, and his parodist. She had contrived to prevent their
meeting as long as her stratagems lasted, till at length she apologised
to the serious bard for inviting him when his mock <em>umbra</em> was to be
present. Astonished, she perceived that both men of genius felt a
mutual esteem for each other’s opposite talent; the ridiculed had perceived
no malignity in the playfulness of the parody, and even seemed
to consider it as a compliment, aware that parodists do not waste their
talent on obscure productions; while the ridiculer himself was very
sensible that he was the inferior poet. The lady-critic had imagined
that <span class="sc lowercase">PARODY</span> must necessarily be malicious; and in some cases it is said
those on whom the parody has been performed, have been of the same
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Parody</span> strongly resembles mimicry, a principle in human nature not
so artificial as it appears. Man may well be defined a mimetic animal.
The African boy who amused the whole kafle he journeyed with, by
mimicking the gestures and the voice of the auctioneer who had sold
him at the slave market a few days before, could have had no sense of
scorn, of superiority, or of malignity; the boy experienced merely the
pleasure of repeating attitudes and intonations which had so forcibly
excited his interest. The numerous parodies of Hamlet’s soliloquy
were never made in derision of that solemn monologue, no more than
the travesties of Virgil by Scarron and Cotton; their authors were
never so gaily mad as that. We have parodies on the Psalms by
Luther; Dodsley parodied the book of Chronicles, and Franklin’s most
beautiful story of Abraham is a parody on the Scripture-style; not one
of these writers, however, proposed to ridicule their originals; some
ingenuity in the application was all that they intended. The lady-critic
alluded to had suffered by a panic, in imagining that a parody
was necessarily a corrosive satire. Had she indeed proceeded one step
further, and asserted that <span class="sc">Parodies</span> might be classed among the most
malicious inventions in literature, in such parodies as Colman and
Lloyd made on Gray’s odes, in their odes to “Oblivion and Obscurity,”
her readings possibly might have supplied the materials of the present
research.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Parodies</span> were frequently practised by the ancients, and with them,
like ourselves, consisted of a work grafted on another work, but which
turned on a different subject by a slight change of the expressions. It
might be a sport of fancy, the innocent child of mirth; or a satirical
arrow drawn from the quiver of caustic criticism; or it was that
malignant art which only studies to make the original of the parody,
however beautiful, contemptible and ridiculous. Human nature thus
enters into the composition of parodies, and their variable character
originates in the purpose of their application.</p>

<p>There is in “the million” a natural taste for farce after tragedy, and
they gladly relieve themselves by mitigating the solemn seriousness of
the tragic drama; for they find, as one of them told us, that it is but a
step from the sublime to the ridiculous; and if this taste be condemned
by the higher order of intellectual persons, and a critic said he would
prefer to have the farce played before the tragedy, the taste for parody
would be still among them, for whatever tends to level a work of genius
is usually very agreeable to a great number of contemporaries. In the
history of <span class="sc lowercase">PARODIES</span>, some of the learned have noticed a supposititious
circumstance, which it is not improbable happened, for it is a very
natural one. When the rhapsodists, who strolled from town to town to
chant different fragments of the poems of Homer, and had recited
some, they were immediately followed by another set of strollers&mdash;buffoons
who made the same audience merry by the burlesque turn
which they gave to the solemn strains which had just so deeply engaged
their attention. It is supposed that we have one of these travesties
of the Iliad in one Sotades, who succeeded by only changing the measure
of the verses without altering the words, which entirely disguised the
Homeric character; fragments of which are scattered in Dionysius
Halicarnassensis, which I leave to the curiosity of the learned Grecian.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>

Homer’s battle of the Frogs and Mice, a learned critic, the elder
Heinsius, asserts, was not written by the poet, but is a parody on the
poem. It is evidently as good humoured an one as any in the “Rejected
Addresses.” And it was because Homer was the most popular poet, that
he was most susceptible of the playful honours of the parodist; unless
the prototype is familiar to us, a parody is nothing! Of these parodists
of Homer we may regret the loss of one. Timon of Philius, whose
parodies were termed Silli, from Silenus being their chief personage;
he levelled them at the sophistical philosophers of his age: his invocation
is grafted on the opening of the Iliad, to recount the evil doings
of those babblers, whom he compares to those bags in which Æolus
deposited all his winds; balloons inflated with empty ideas! We should
like to have appropriated some of these <em>silli</em>, or parodies of Timon the
Sillograph, which, however, seem to have been at times calumnious.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>

Shenstone’s “School Mistress,” and some few other ludicrous poems,
derive much of their merit from parody.</p>

<p>This taste for parodies was very prevalent with the Grecians, and is
a species of humour which perhaps has been too rarely practised by the
moderns: Cervantes has some passages of this nature in his parodies
of the old chivalric romances; Fielding in some parts of his Tom Jones
and Joseph Andrews, in his burlesque poetical descriptions; and Swift
in his “Battle of Books,” and “Tale of a Tub,” but few writers have
equalled the delicacy and felicity of Pope’s parodies in the “Rape of
the Lock.” Such parodies give refinement to burlesque.</p>

<p>The ancients made a liberal use of it in their satirical comedy, and
sometimes carried it on through an entire work, as in the Menippean
satire, Seneca’s mock <cite>Eloge</cite> of Claudius, and Lucian in his Dialogues.
There are parodies even in Plato, and an anecdotical one recorded of this
philosopher shows them in their most simple state. Dissatisfied with
his own poetical essays he threw them into the flames; that is, the
sage resolved to sacrifice his verses to the god of fire; and in repeating
that line in Homer where Thetis addresses Vulcan to implore his aid,
the application became a parody, although it required no other change
than the insertion of the philosopher’s name instead of the goddess’s:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="center">“Vulcan, arise! ’tis <em>Plato</em> claims thy aid!”</p>

<p class="unindent">Boileau affords a happy instance of this simple parody. Corneille, in
his Cid, makes one of his personages remark,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<div class="i1">“Pour grands que soient les rois ils sont ce que nous sommes,</div>
<div class="i1">Ils peuvent se tromper comme les autres hommes.”</div>

<p class="unindent">A slight alteration became a fine parody in Boileau’s “Chapelain
Décoiflé.”</p>

<p>We find in Athenæus the name of the Inventor of a species of
parody which more immediately engages our notice&mdash;<span class="sc lowercase">DRAMATIC
PARODIES</span>. It appears this inventor was a satirist, so that the
lady-critic, whose opinion we had the honour of noticing, would be
warranted by appealing to its origin to determine the nature of the
thing. A dramatic parody, which produced the greatest effect, was
“the Gigantomachia.” as appears by the only circumstance known of
it. Never laughed the Athenians so heartily as at its representation,
for the fatal news of the deplorable state to which the affairs of the
republic were reduced in Sicily arrived at its first representation&mdash;and
the Athenians continued laughing to the end! as the modern Athenians,
the volatile Parisians, might in their national concern of an <span class="sc lowercase">OPERA
COMIQUE</span>. It was the business of the dramatic parody to turn the
solemn tragedy, which the audience had just seen exhibited, into a
farcical comedy; the same actors who had appeared in magnificent
dresses, now returned on the stage in grotesque habiliments, with odd
postures and gestures, while the story, though the same, was incongruous
and ludicrous. The Cyclops of Euripides is probably the only
remaining specimen; for this may be considered as a parody of the
ninth book of the Odyssey&mdash;the adventures of Ulysses in the cave of
Polyphemus, where Silenus and a chorus of satyrs are farcically introduced,
to contrast with the grave narrative of Homer, of the shifts and
escape of the cunning man “from the one-eyed ogre.” The jokes are
<span class="pageno">2</span>
too coarse for the French taste of Brumoy, who, in his translation, goes
on with a critical growl and foolish apology for Euripides having
written a farce; Brumoy, like Pistol, is forced to eat his onion, but
with a worse grace, swallowing and execrating to the end.</p>

<p>In dramatic composition, Aristophanes is perpetually hooking in
parodies of Euripides, whom of all poets he hated, as well as of
Æschylus, Sophocles, and other tragic bards. Since that Grecian wit,
at length, has found a translator saturated with his genius, and an
interpreter as philosophical, the subject of Grecian parody will probably
be reflected in a clearer light from his researches.</p>

<p>Dramatic parodies in modern literature were introduced by our
vivacious neighbours, and may be said to constitute a class of literary
satires peculiar to the French nation. What had occurred in Greece a
similar gaiety of national genius unconsciously reproduced. The
dramatic parodies in our own literature, as in “The Rehearsal,”
“Tom Thumb,” and “The Critic,” however exquisite, are confined
to particular passages, and are not grafted on a whole original; we
have neither naturalised the dramatic parody into a species, nor dedicated
to it the honours of a separate theatre.</p>

<p>This peculiar dramatic satire, a burlesque of an entire tragedy, the
volatile genius of the Parisians accomplished. Whenever a new
tragedy, which still continues the favourite species of drama with the
French, attracted the notice of the town, shortly after up rose its parody
at the Italian theatre. A French tragedy is most susceptible of this
sort of ridicule, by applying its declamatory style, its exaggerated
sentiments, and its romantic out-of-the-way nature to the commonplace
incidents and persons of domestic life; out of the stuff of which they
made their emperors, their heroes, and their princesses, they cut out a
pompous country justice, a hectoring tailor, or an impudent mantua-maker;
but it was not merely this travesty of great personages, nor
the lofty effusions of one in a lowly station, which terminated the
object of parody; it intended a better object, that of more obviously
exposing the original for any absurdity in its scenes, or in its
catastrophe, and dissecting faulty characters; in a word, critically
weighing the nonsense of the poet. It sometimes became a refined
instructor for the public, whose discernment is often blinded by party
or prejudice. It was, too, a severe touch-stone for genius: Racine,
some say, smiled, others say he did not, when he witnessed Harlequin,
in the language of Titus to Berenice, declaiming on some ludicrous
affair to Columbine; La Motte was very sore, and Voltaire and
others shrunk away with a cry&mdash;from a parody! Voltaire was angry
when he witnessed his <cite>Mariamne</cite> parodied by <cite>La mauvaise Mênage</cite>; or
“Bad House-keeping:” the aged, jealous Herod was turned into an
old cross country justice; Varus, bewitched by Mariamne, strutted a
dragoon; and the whole establishment showed it was under very
bad management. Fuzelier collected some of these parodies,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
 and not
unskilfully defends their nature and their object against the protest of
La Motte, whose tragedies had severely suffered from these burlesques.
His celebrated domestic tragedy of Inez de Castro, the fable of which
turns on a concealed and clandestine marriage, produced one of the
happiest parodies in <cite>Agnes de Chaillot</cite>. In the parody the cause of the
mysterious obstinacy of Pierrot the son, in persisting to refuse the
hand of the daughter of his mother-in-law Madame <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Baillive</i>, is thus
discovered by her to Monsieur <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Baillif</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="unindent">The Baillif exclaims,</p>
<p class="p0 center">“Ma servante?”</p>

<p>This single word was the most lively and fatal criticism of the tragic
action of Inez de Castro, which, according to the conventional decorum
and fastidious code of French criticism, grossly violated the majesty of
Melpomene, by giving a motive and an object so totally undignified to
the tragic tale. In the parody there was something ludicrous when
the secret came out which explained poor Pierrot’s long concealed
perplexities, in the maid-servant bringing forward a whole legitimate
family of her own! La Motte was also galled by a projected parody
of his “Machabees”&mdash;where the hasty marriage of the young
Machabeus, and the sudden conversion of the amorous Antigone, who,
for her first penitential act, persuades a youth to marry her, without
first deigning to consult her respectable mother, would have produced
an excellent scene for the parody. But La Motte prefixed an angry
preface to his Inez de Castro; he inveighs against all parodies, which
he asserts to be merely a French fashion (we have seen, however, that
it was once Grecian), the offspring of a dangerous spirit of ridicule, and
the malicious amusement of superficial minds.&mdash;“Were this true,”
retorts Fuzelier, “we ought to detest parodies; but we maintain, that
far from converting virtue into a paradox, and degrading truth by
ridicule, <span class="sc">Parody</span> will only strike at what is chimerical and false; it is
not a piece of buffoonery so much as a critical exposition. What do
we parody but the absurdities of dramatic writers, who frequently
make their heroes act against nature, common sense and truth?
After all” he ingeniously adds, “it is the public, not we, who are the
authors of these <span class="sc lowercase">PARODIES</span>; for they are usually but the echoes of the
pit, and we parodists have only to give a dramatic form to the opinions
and observations we hear. Many tragedies,” Fuzelier, with admirable
truth, observes, “disguise vices into virtues, and <span class="sc lowercase">PARODIES</span> unmask
them.” We have had tragedies recently which very much
required parodies to expose them, and to shame our inconsiderate
audiences, who patronised these monsters of false passions. The
rants and bombast of some of these might have produced, with little or
no alteration of the inflated originals, “A Modern Rehearsal,” or a
new “Tragedy for Warm Weather.”</p>

<p>Of <span class="sc lowercase">PARODIES</span>, we may safely approve of their legitimate use, and even
indulge their agreeable maliciousness; while we must still dread
that extraordinary facility to which the public, or rather human
nature, are so prone, as sometimes to laugh at what, at another time, they
would shed tears.</p>

<p>Tragedy is rendered comic or burlesque by altering the <em>station</em> and
<em>manners</em> of the <em>persons</em>; and the reverse may occur, of raising what is
comic and burlesque into tragedy. On so little depends the sublime
or the ridiculous! Beattie says “In most human characters there
are blemishes, moral, intellectual, or corporeal; by exaggerating which,
to a certain degree, you may form a comic character; as by raising
the virtues, abilities, or external advantages of individuals, you form
epic or tragic characters;” a subject humourously touched upon by
Lloyd, in the prologue to “The Jealous Wife.”</p>

<span class="sc">efore</span> quoting the Parodies on the
Poems of Oliver Goldsmith, mention
must be made of three instances, in
which he, himself, borrowed ideas from
French sources. These are the well-known
“Elegy on the Glory of her Sex, Mrs. Mary Blaize,”
the “Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog,” and the
favourite verses, entitled “Stanzas on Woman,”
commencing “When lovely woman stoops to folly,”
which appeared in “The Vicar of Wakefield,” when
first published in 1765. Before Goldsmith settled
down in London as a struggling man of letters, he
had spent some time wandering about on the Continent,
and had obtained a fairly good insight into
foreign literature. He had, therefore, in all probability
seen the poems of Ségur, printed in Paris in
1719, in which the following lines <span class="lock">occur:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Ménage introduces <cite>Le Chanson de la Galisse</cite>
without any other explanation than that it relates
to the adventures of an imaginary character, he
does not mention the Author’s name, nor does he
refer to any other poem having any resemblance to
it. Yet there was a “Chanson” written in exactly
the same style and metre, recording (in burlesque it
is true) the adventures of a brave French officer,
named La Palice. And what makes it more remarkable
is, that this poem was written by a friend
of M. Gilles de Ménage, the grave and religious
Bernard de la Monnoye, who conceived the idea
of personifying nonsensical truths in his <cite>Complaint
upon the Life and Death of La Palice</cite>; careless of
attaching popular ridicule to a name which should
excite only recollections of heroic and military
virtue.</p>

<p>Concerning this <cite>Chanson de la Palice</cite> there was
a long article in <cite>Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal</cite>, as
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
far back as July, 1845, from which the following
notes are <span class="lock">extracted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Thanks to this strange production, we know that the
famous La Palice died in losing his life, and that he would
not have had his equal had he been alone in the world. Doubtless
it is satisfactory to know that he could never make up
his mind to load his pistols when he had no powder; and
that when he wrote verse he did not write prose; or that
while drinking he never spoke a word. These are certainly
notable details concerning the habits and character of this
great man, but it is also certain that La Palice had greater
claims to admiration which may be brought to light in illustrating
some stanzas of the biographical ballad. The song
begins <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem small">
<div class="i1">‘Please you, gentlemen, to hear</div>
<div class="i2">The song of La Palice;</div>
<div class="i1">It surely will delight you all,</div>
<div class="i2">Provided that it please,’</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="blockquote"> Besides this proposition, the historian would have done
well to tell us that La Palice was of noble race, for his
grandfather, an earlier Jacques de Chabannes, after valiantly
defending Castillon against Talbot, the English Achilles,
died of his wounds at the siege of this city, which, two
years afterwards (17th July, 1453), cost the life of his illustrious
enemy.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem small">
<div class="i1">‘La Palice but little wealth</div>
<div class="i2">To his renown could bring;</div>
<div class="i1">And when abundance was his lot,</div>
<div class="i2">He lacked no single thing.’</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="blockquote"> Abundance of glory, of honours, of treasures, of war on
battle fields; this was surely what the poet meant to say.
He ought to have been rich indeed, when three sovereigns
successively invested him with the titles of marshal of
France, governor of Bourbonnais, of Auvergne, of Forez and
the Lyonnais.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem small">
<div class="i1">‘He was versed in all the games</div>
<div class="i2">Played at the academy;</div>
<div class="i1">And never was unfortunate</div>
<div class="i2">When he won the victory.’</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="blockquote"> Those which he gained are faithfully chronicled in history.
First, stands Marignan in 1515, next Fontarabia, in 1521;
then Bicocca, in Lombardy, where La Palice, being second
in command, made incredible exertions to recover the fortunes
of the day; and last, Marseilles, which went to sleep one
night Spanish, and woke up French the next morning,
because a great Captain, Chabannes de la Palice, had scaled
her walls, and effaced by dint of courage the shame with
which the desertion of Bourbon had tarnished the name of
French gentlemen.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem small">
<div class="i1">‘To do and dare in his career,</div>
<div class="i2">He readily inclined;</div>
<div class="i1">And when he stood before the king,</div>
<div class="i2">He was not, sure, behind.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Fate dealt to him a cruel blow.</div>
<div class="i2">And stretched him on the ground;</div>
<div class="i1">And ’tis believed that since he died,</div>
<div class="i2">It was a mortal wound.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His death was sore and terrible,</div>
<div class="i2">Upon a stone his head;</div>
<div class="i1">He would have died more easily</div>
<div class="i2">Upon a feather bed.’</div>
</div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="blockquote"> Chabannes made a sortie with a handful of brave fellows
from the fort which he defended against the Spanish army,
and saw all those who followed fall around him. A Spanish
soldier climbs over the barrier of corpses piled before him,
aims a tremendous blow at his head, beneath which the
brave La Palice fell senseless to the earth,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem small">

<p class="center ls">THE HERMIT.</p>

<p>This favourite poem originally appeared in “The
Vicar of Wakefield,” which was published in the
year 1765. Dr. Goldsmith was accused of having
borrowed the idea of the ballad from “The
Friar of Orders Gray,” and in June, 1767, he sent
the following reply to the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Chronicle:</p>

<p class="blockquote"> “A correspondent of yours accuses me of having taken
a ballad I published sometime ago, from one by the ingenious
Mr. Percy. I do not think there is any great resemblance
between the two pieces in question. If there be any, his
ballad is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy some
years ago; and he (as we both considered these things as
trifles at best) told me with his usual good humour, the next
time I saw him, that he had taken my plan to form the
fragments of Shakespeare into a ballad of his own. He then
read me his little Cento, if I may so call it, and I highly
approved it.”</p>

<p>In confirmation of this statement Bishop Percy
afterwards added a note to “The Friar of Orders
Gray,” stating that it was only just to declare that
Goldsmith’s Poem was written first, and that if
there had been any imitation in the case, they
would be found to be both indebted to the beautiful
old ballad <cite>Gentle Herdsman</cite>. This ballad is
reprinted below, with Goldsmith’s <cite>The Hermit</cite>, and
a few verses from Bishop Percy’s <cite>Friar of Orders
Gray</cite>.</p>

<p>It will be seen that although the poems have
several points of resemblance, yet each has a distinct
individuality of its own.</p>

<p class="blockquote"> “Dispersed through Shakespeare’s plays are innumerable
little fragments of Ancient ballads, the entire copies of
which could not be recovered. Many of these being of the
most beautiful and pathetic simplicity, the Editor was tempted
to select some of them, and with a few supplemental stanzas
to connect them together, and form them into a little tale,
which is here submitted to the reader’s candour.”</p>

<p class="center">THE SPEAKER’S DINNER.</p>

<p>The following political paraphrase of Oliver
Goldsmith’s pleasing poem <cite>Retaliation</cite>, is taken
from an anonymous collection, published in 1814,
entitled “Posthumous Parodies and other Pieces,
composed by several of our most celebrated Poets,
but not published in any former Edition of their
Works.” Several pieces from this collection have
already been quoted in <cite>Parodies</cite>; they have nearly
all a strong party bias in favour of the Tory Government
of the day. The Politicians alluded to in
the poem are, the Earl of Liverpool, Premier 1812
to 1827, died in 1828; Viscount Castlereagh
(afterwards Marquis of Londonderry) Foreign
Secretary, committed suicide in 1822; Lord Grenville,
died in 1834; the Right Hon. George Canning
author of the witty parodies in the “Anti-jacobin,”
died 1827; Sir Francis Burdett, an opposition
<abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr>, father of Lady Burdett Coutts, died 1844;
Viscount Sidmouth, died 1844; the Right Hon.
John Wilson Croker, died 1857; Samuel Whitbread,
<abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr>, died 1815; the Right Hon. R. B.
Sheridan, died 1816; Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough,
died 1818; William Cobbett, <abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr>, for
Oldham, died 1835; and Robert Waithman, <abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr>,
Alderman and Lord Mayor of London, who died
in 1833.</p>

<p>In Scribner’s Magazine for 1881 appeared a set
of variations on “Home, Sweet Home,” treated
in the different styles of Swinburne, Bret Harte,
Austin Dobson, Walt Whitman and Oliver Goldsmith.

<p>In that amusing book, “The Reminiscences
of Henry Angelo” (published by Colburn and
Bentley in 1830), some account is given of the
satirical writer, Anthony Pasquin, whose real name,
by the way, was Williams. This man who had been
originally brought up to the profession of an
Engraver, threw aside the graving tool, and adopted
the less respectable calling of a satirical lampoonist.
He was an unprincipled impudent sponge, who
spoke ill of every one, and forced himself on the
hospitality of all who knew him, so that it was
said of him that “he never opened his mouth but
at another man’s expence.” In 1786 he contributed
to a weekly paper then appearing, entitled <cite>The
Devil</cite>, from which Angelo quotes part of a long
Parody upon the Deserted Village, written by
Pasquin asserting the inferiority of the actors then
upon the stage, to their predecessors, an assertion
frequently made by elderly people even in these
days.</p>

<p>There was another Poem written in imitation of
<cite>The Deserted Village</cite> entitled “<cite>The Frequented
Village</cite>, a Poem dedicated to Oliver Goldsmith,”
by E. Young, L.L.D. (J. Godwin). Unfortunately
there does not appear to be any copy of this
Poem in the Library of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith, died on April 4th, 1774, and
within a few days of his death a poem, written by
Courtney Melmoth, was published by T. Beckett, in
the Strand. “The Tears of Genius,” as the Poem
was called, was dedicated to Sir Joshua Reynolds;
part being written in imitation of the style of
<cite>The Deserted Village</cite>, whilst another part, deploring
the death of the poet Gray, was written in imitation
of his Elegy in a Country Churchyard. There
were also allusions to several other minor Poets
but the whole effusion lacks interest.</p>

<p>The Vicar of Wakefield is probably, of all
English stories, the one which has been most
widely read, (perhaps only excepting Robinson
Crusoe), and has taken most thoroughly hold of
the hearts of English speaking people. It was first
printed at Salisbury, by Collins, and was issued by
Francis Newberry, in 2 vols., in March 1766. A
dainty facsimile of this original Edition has
recently been published by Mr. Elliot Stock.</p>

<p>A dramatic version of <cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite>,
by W. G. Wills, entitled <cite>Olivia</cite>, has for some
time past been attracting large audiences to the
Lyceum Theatre, to see Henry Irving and Miss
Ellen Terry in the parts of the Vicar and his daughter.
The success of <cite>Olivia</cite> tempted the inevitable
travestie, and on Saturday, August 8, 1885, “The
Vicar of Wide-a-Wakefield, or the Miss-Terry-ous
Uncle.” a Respectful Burlesque Perversion by
H. P. Stephens and W. Yardley, was produced at
the Gaiety Theatre. The burlesque had but little
humour, or literary merit, and although Mr. Arthur
Roberts’s imitation of Henry Irving as Dr. Primrose
was at times quaint and amusing, the entire success
of the production was due to the extraordinary
caricature of Miss Ellen Terry given by Miss
Laura Linden, who has a perfect genius for such
mimicry. Not only in voice, but in gestures,
movements, and delivery, the resemblance was
striking, and wonderfully sustained throughout the
piece, with only just sufficient exaggeration to produce
the intended effect of caricature. The plan
of the authors of the burlesque consists in making
the virtuous persons of the original appear to be
more or less villainous and unprincipled, while the
villain of the original is made out to be the only
pure-minded and moral individual in the piece.
For instance, the Vicar is a terrible old scoundrel,
who only pretends to have lost all his money, who
knows that Mr. Burchell is the baronet in disguise,
and who schemes to get his daughters and son
married, and performs the nuptials himself, under
different disguises, so as to pocket the fees.
Burchell is another villain, having unlawfully possessed
himself of his nephew’s titles and estates.
Olivia is a very forward minx, who tells the virtuous
Squire Thornhill all about the pleasures of London,
especially the gay and giddy Inventories, and who
begs and induces him to run away with her. Even
Sophia is cunning enough to discover Burchell’s
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
identity, and to sum up all the worldly advantages
of catching him matrimonially.</p>

<span class="sc">aving</span> already given Parodies of
several of the most celebrated English,
Irish, and American Poets, it is advisable
to turn now to Scotland for an
Author, and although, perhaps, the
genius and writings of Campbell were not very
distinctly Scotch, most of his poems have achieved
world-wide fame, and have consequently been very
frequently parodied.</p>

<p>Thomas Campbell was born and educated in
Glasgow, where he achieved remarkable success
in his studies; after travelling some time upon
the Continent, he came to London, married, and
went to reside at Sydenham. His writings soon
attracted considerable attention, he was appointed
Professor of Poetry to the Royal Institution, and
became Editor of the New Monthly Magazine, to
which he contributed many interesting articles.
But an Act of Parliament should be passed to prohibit
men of genius from acting as Editors, the
work and worry kill them, and the duties leave no
time for original compositions. It is, therefore,
not surprising that Campbell was not a prolific
poet, and Washington Irving relates that he once
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
expressed his regret to Mrs. Campbell that her
husband did not write more verse. “It is unfortunate,”
she replied, “that he lives in the same age
with Scott and Byron who write so much, and so
rapidly. He is apt to undervalue his own works,
and to consider his little light put out, whenever
they come blazing out with their great torches.”
Irving subsequently repeated this to the great Sir
Walter, who, with his usual kindness, and good
humour, replied, “How can Campbell mistake the
matter so much? Poetry goes by quality, not by
bulk. My poems are mere cairngorms, wrought up,
perhaps, with a cunning hand, but they are mere
Scotch pebbles, after all; now Tom Campbell’s are
real diamonds, and diamonds of the first water.”</p>

<p>Of the “diamonds” produced by Campbell,
some of the most popular are Lochiel’s Warning,
Hohenlinden, the Soldier’s Dream, Lord Ullin’s
Daughter, and The Exile of Erin, but no one of his
poems has been so often parodied as his famous
naval ode “Ye Mariners of England.”</p>

<p>The Battle of Hohenlinden was fought on December 3,
1800, when the French, under General Moreau gained a
victory over the Austrians. Campbell witnessed the
battle from the monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jacob, it is therefore
somewhat surprising that his poem should, in its details,
be so completely at variance with the reality of history.
The Colonel of the Sixteenth Lancers, in describing the
battle said that the “victory was obtained almost without
an effort of the General, or any very great bravery on the
part of his troops.” Some of the poetical allusions, as
for instance “the black Iser,” “bannered Munich,” and
the “night scene” were altogether imaginary, and nothing
can be called true but the beautiful stanza that concludes
the Ode. Whilst a writer in “Notes and Queries” suggested
that even this stanza was poetically faulty, and
proposed it should be altered to:</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Bunn, then lessee and manager of
Drury Lane Theatre, had endeavoured to secure
the services of Miss Jenny Lind, but she accepted
an engagement under Mr. Lumley, and made her
first appearance at Her Majesty’s Theatre, Haymarket,
on May 4, 1847. Her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> was a brilliant
triumph, and for the short time she remained on
the lyric stage she was extremely popular. But in
1851 she married M. Otto Goldschmidt, and retired
from the stage, although she has occasionally performed
since, principally for the benefit of public
charities, or other philanthropic objects.</p>

<p>It is said that Campbell sent the MS. of Hohenlinden
to the <cite>Greenock Advertiser</cite>, but that it was
rejected, with a polite intimation “that it did not
come up to the Editor’s standard, and that poetry
was evidently not the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</i> of the contributor.”</p>

<p>A version of Hohenlinden in Latin sapphics,
probably written by Father Prout (the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Francis
Mahony) appeared in Blackwood’s Magazine, in
1834; and another version, in Latin Alcaics,
“Prælium Lindenium” by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Fellowes

<p>Campbell began this famous Ode, in Edinburgh, in 1799,
and finished it at Altona in 1800. He at first styled it
“Alteration of the old ballad ‘Ye Gentlemen of England’
composed on the prospect of a Russian War;” it was published
early in 1801, in the <cite>Naval Chronicle</cite>, with the line
“Where Granvill (boast of freedom) fell,” instead of</p>

<p class="center">“Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell,”</p>

<p class="unindent">this being an allusion to the brave Sir Richard Granvill, who
was killed in 1591, in the fight of the “Revenge” against
the Spanish Armada.</p>

<p>After the death of Lord Nelson, at Trafalgar, in 1805,
Campbell revised the poem, and then introduced the
beautiful line</p>

<p class="center">“Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell.”</p>

<p>The poem is frequently printed with the original date of
1800, and with the line about the fall of Nelson, without any
explanation of these facts, thus making it appear that
Campbell, had anticipated the loss of the great sailor five
years before it occured.</p>

had reference to the commercial panic of the

appeared in <cite>Truth</cite>, Sept. 25, 1879, commencing</p>

<p class="center">“Ye Ministers of England.”</p>

<p>Amongst the curiosities of literature may be classed
an extraordinary collection entitled “<span class="sc">Divine
Songs of the Muggletonians</span>,” printed in 1829,
and now very scarce. Amongst these so-called
Divine Songs are some to be sung to such tunes as
“God save the King,” “Hearts of Oak,” “De’il
tak the wars,” and one there is which commences
as follows, in imitation of Campbell’s <span class="lock"><cite>Mariners</cite>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This Parody refers to the late Sir John Cam
Hobhouse (Lord Broughton), who long represented
Westminster in Parliament, he was succeeded by
Sir De Lacy Evans, then Colonel De Lacy Evans.
The “Sir Frank” alluded to in the fourth verse
was Sir Francis Burdett, a very advanced Radical
politician for those days. He was the father of Lady
Burdett Coutts, whose husband has recently been
elected member for Westminster in the Conservative
interest.</p>

<p>The two following parodies of this poem occur
in <cite>The University Snowdrop</cite>, an Edinburgh College
Magazine. These and the interesting explanatory
notes which accompany them have been kindly
furnished by Mr. James Gordon, F.S.A., Scotland.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The winter of 1837-8 was very severe, and there was a
heavy fall of snow in Edinburgh. On the 10th January
some snowballing took place in front of the College, in which
the students took part. The warfare between the students
and the townspeople was renewed on the 11th, and became
more serious. Several shop windows were broken, the
shops were closed, and the street traffic suspended. The
students, believing that the constables took the side of the
mob against them, appeared on the 12th armed with sticks,
to defend themselves against the constables batons. Then
a regular riot took place, sticks and batons being freely used,
and matters became so serious that the magistrates found it
necessary to send to the Castle for a detachment of soldiers
of the 79th Highlanders, which arrived and drew up across
the College quadrangle, and peace was restored. Five
students who had been most active in the fray were tried by
the Sheriff and were acquitted. The trial lasted three days.
Among the witnesses for the prosecution were the Lord
Provost, some Bailies, and the heads of the police force.
The students were defended by Patrick Robertson, in a most
amusing speech. He was made a Lord of Session, and
wrote some volumes of poetry, now unsaleable, if ever they
did sell. Lockhart wrote an epitaph for <span class="lock">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote unindent">A report of the trial was published, which was followed by
“<cite>The University Snowdrop</cite>, an appendix to the Great Trial,
containing a selection of squibs, old and new, descriptive of
the wars of the quadrangle and the consequences thereof.
With magnificent embellishments.” Edinburgh, 1838.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The “embellishments” are pen and ink portraits of the
principal parties concerned in the riot, drawn by Edward
Forbes, then a student, who became a Professor. (His
widow married Major Yelverton, from which event sprang
the famous case of Longworth against Yelverton.)</p>

<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, published by J. Johnston, London, 1813,
a dreary little book, which was, no doubt, brought
into existence in consequence of the success of
“The Rejected Addresses,” contains poems which
are supposed to bear some resemblance to those of
Lord Byron, Walter Scott, Wordsworth, Southey,
and others. Specimen the Ninth is devoted to the
description of the sorrows of Ireland, written after
the style of Campbell’s Exile of Erin.</p>

<p>Of all the Poems written by Burns no one is so
grand, or so generally popular as Bruce’s address to
his troops, which Burns is said to have composed as
he rode home through a heavy storm. He sent the

<p>Mr. Thompson, in acknowledging the Poem,
<span class="lock">remarked:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"> “Your heroic ode is to me the noblest composition of the
kind in the Scottish language. I happened to dine yesterday
with a party of your friends to whom I read it. They
were all charmed with it, entreated me to find out a suitable
air for it, and reprobated the idea of giving it a tune so
totally devoid of interest or grandeur as ‘Hey tuttie taittie.’</p>

<p class="blockquote"> I have been running over the whole hundred airs, of which
I lately sent you the list; and I think ‘Lewie Gordon’ is
most happily adapted to your ode; at least with a very short
variation of the fourth line, which I shall presently submit to
you. There is in ‘Lewie Gordon’ more of the grand than
the plaintive, particularly when it is sung with a degree of
spirit which your words would oblige the singer to give it.
I would have no scruple about substituting your ode in the
room of ‘Lewie Gordon,’ which has neither the interest,
the grandeur, nor the poetry that characterize your verses.
Now the variation I have to suggest on the last line of each
verse, the only line too short for the air, is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Verse 1st, Or to <em>glorious</em> victorie.</div>
<div class="i3">2nd, <em>Chains</em>&mdash;chains and slaverie.</div>
<div class="i3">3rd, Let him, <em>let him</em> turn and flee.</div>
<div class="i3">4th, Let him <em>bravely</em> follow me.</div>

<div class="i3">6th, Let us, <em>let us</em> do, or die!</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="blockquote"> If you connect each line with its own verse, I do not
think you will find that either the sentiment or the expression
loses any of its energy.”</p>

<p>Acting upon these suggestions Burns altered his
Poem to suit the music, but in simplicity and
grandeur the first version was far superior to the
second.</p>

<p>In the same year another skit at the Whig party
appeared. The allusions it contains are to Lord
Grey, who eventually passed the Reform Bill,
Joseph Hume, the political economist and exposer
of Parliamentary corruption; R. Carlile, the
publisher of Tom Paine’s, and other advanced
Radical works; Leigh Hunt, part proprietor of the
Examiner, who had been imprisoned for calling
the Prince Regent a “Fat Adonis of Fifty”;
Henry Hunt, who had suffered a long imprisonment
for attending a meeting at Manchester to
agitate for the Reform of the House of Commons,
in 1819; and Henry Brougham, afterwards Lord
Chancellor, who was instrumental in eventually
passing that measure.</p>

<p>The above is the version of this song as given in the
Works of Burns, but <cite>John Anderson, my jo</cite>, existed as a
song, under different forms, long before his time. In
Percy’s <cite>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</cite> it is traced back to the
time of the Reformation, when many ridiculous and
obscene songs were composed to be sung to the tunes of
favorite hymns in the Latin Service, to ridicule the Roman
Catholic faith. The explanation is important, and should
be borne in mind, as accounting for the fact that many of
the absurd and nonsensical old Scotch Songs, which
Burns either entirely re-wrote, or remodelled, were wedded
to really grand original music.</p>

<p>The first, and only, verse fit to quote originally ran thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“John Anderson, my jo, cum in as ye gae bye,</div>
<div class="i1">And ye sail get a sheips heid, weel baken in a pye;</div>
<div class="i1">Weel baken in a pye, and the haggis in a pot:</div>

<p>The stanza with which this song begins, is the chorus
of the old song under this title; and though perfectly
suitable to that wicked but witty ballad, it has
no accordance with the strain of delicate and tender sentiment
of this improved song. With regard to the five
additional stanzas, though they are in the spirit of the two
stanzas that are unquestionably by Burns, every reader
of discernment will see they are by an inferior hand; and
the real author of them, ought neither to have given them,
nor suffered them to be given, to the world, as the production
of Burns.</p>

<p>This song was written by the late Charles
Neaves, Advocate, who, on his elevation in 1854
to the Bench of the Supreme Court in Scotland,
sat as Lord Neaves. He was an able judge, a
genial, witty man, and a frequent contributor to
Blackwood’s Magazine. Some of his best pieces
were collected and published in a small volume,
entitled “<cite>Songs and Verses, by an Old Contributor to
Maga</cite>,” by W. Blackwood and Sons. Lord Neaves
was over 77 years of age when he died in 1877.</p>

<p class="center ls">TAM O’SHANTER.</p>

<p>In a recent number of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>
(December 19, 1885), there was a long article, by
Mr. Shirley Hibberd, on the origin of Burns’s
masterpiece. It contains so much interesting information
that readers of Burns will, no doubt, be
pleased to have the following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the year 1790, when Burns wrote <cite>Tam o’Shanter</cite>,
stories of witches were current in Scotland, and there was
yet a large survival of popular belief in their power and
the diabolical source thereof. The poem bears evidence
of a reality that has hitherto failed of recognition.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The confession of certain Scotch witches at the assizes
held at Paisley, February 15, 1678, must have been well
known to Burns, for it was a theme of fireside conversation
in his youth, and there were many living who
remembered the whole of the circumstances. That confession
establishes the reality of witchcraft. The confession
is cited in <cite>Demonologia</cite> (Bumpus, 1827).</p>

<p class="blockquote">In a letter to Francis Grose, Burns gives three prose
versions of the story. In one, a farmer who “had got
courageously drunk in the smithy,” saw the “infernal
junto” play their antics in Alloway Kirk, and managed
to carry off the cauldron in which the hell-broth was prepared
from the bodies of the unchristened children. In
another, a farmer of Carrick witnessed the incantation,
and, losing his self-command in admiring a buxom lass
who danced with peculiar liveliness, shouted the dread
words, “Weel luppen, Maggie, wi’ the short sark.” In
this case the speed of the horse was insufficient for his
complete escape, for at “the keystane o’ the brig” the
witches despoiled the horse of its tail, and the stumpy
steed became a witness of the truth of the farmer’s
declaration. The third story is of no account in this
connexion.</p>

<p class="blockquote">In Robert Chambers’s <cite>Life and Works of Burns</cite>, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 152,
we are told that “the country people of Ayrshire
unmythicise the narration, and point to a real Tam and
Souter Johnny,” the first being Douglas Graham, farmer,
of Shanter; the other, his neighbour, John Davidson,
noted for telling the “queerest stories.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">That a drunken freak and the lies told to cover it
explain the form of the poem is well enough. But we
have in these “facts of the case” no explanation of the
motive, no indication of the source of the inspiration, no
key to the supernatural business. The moral is obvious
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénoûment</i> proves the impotency of witches, and
mocks the prevalent belief in their powers. These considerations,
however, do not remove witches and witchcraft
from the category of historical facts.</p>

<p class="blockquote">An important commentary on the subject will be found
in a volume entitled <cite>Interesting Roman Antiquities recently
discovered in Fife</cite>, by <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Andrew Small (Edinburgh,
1823.) In this work it is stated that near the Castle Law,
Abernethy, were twenty-two graves of witches, and near
by is the hill on which they were burned. A Mr. Ross,
laird of Invernethy in the reign of James <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, became, as
justice of the peace, responsible for the apprehension of
certain witches, and made the discovery that their names
were entered in a book. He set his mind upon obtaining
this written record, and, as one step thereto, he persuaded
a women who was a member of the gang to permit
him to accompany her to a meeting. The laird went to
the meeting on a fast mare, and kept his seat while the
orgies proceeded, and obtained possession of the book
wherein to inscribe his name with his own blood. But
<a name="Part_28" id="Part_28"></a><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
instead of complying with the rule he put spurs to his
steed and fled with the book, “while out the hellish
legion sallied.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">The witches swarmed upon him, but the laird kept his
seat, and the mare kept her tail, and he outran them and
got home, and quickly locked himself in and copied the
names from the book. By this time the clamouring
crowd had reached the house, and he dispersed them by
throwing out the book, which they gladly seized and
carried away.</p>

<p class="blockquote">In introducing the story Mr. Small says: “If ever the
poet Burns had been in this part of the country, I would
have said he had taken the leading ideas or hints from it
in his humorous and excellent poem.”</p>

<div class="i1">It was three gallant Chinamen,</div>
<div class="i2">With long tail and pig eye,</div>
<div class="i1">And they have sworn a solemn oath,</div>
<div class="i2">Sir T. Tea-leaf must die.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And they have ta’en and flung him down</div>
<div class="i2">Upon an iron bed,</div>
<div class="i1">And underneath, with cruel hand,</div>
<div class="i2">Have heaped the ashes red.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They’ve spread him out, and pressed him down,</div>
<div class="i2">And turned him o’er and o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">They’ve dried him up, until he curled,</div>
<div class="i2">And writhed in suffering sore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In vain he twisted and he turned,</div>
<div class="i2">In vain he cried for grace;</div>
<div class="i1">They kept him so, and scorched him till</div>
<div class="i2">He grew black in the face.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But finding he was still alive,</div>
<div class="i2">Their malice waxed more keen;</div>
<div class="i1">They dosed him first with Prussian blue</div>
<div class="i2">Till his poor face turned green.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">What sparks of life might still remain</div>
<div class="i2">Determined to foredo,</div>
<div class="i1">They gave him next a bitter draught</div>
<div class="i2">Of gum and catechu.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And on his death his name they changed,</div>
<div class="i2">Lest men their crime should know,</div>
<div class="i1">And when men asked, “Who’s that lies there?”</div>
<div class="i2">They answered, “Young Pekoe.”</div>

<div class="i1">Whereas his name and family,</div>

<div class="i1">Related to the old Congous,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Lest men should recognise his dust,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Their poison’d victim then they wrapp’d</div>
<div class="i2">In lead, with well-feign’d grief,</div>

<div class="i2">The epitaph was true,</div>

<div class="i2">And “lie” such Tea-leaves do.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now Tea-leaf’s name is in repute</div>
<div class="i2">In lands beyond the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">Where maiden ladies love him much,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! little dream these ancient maids</div>
<div class="i2">Of Chinaman’s vile craft,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor think, while chatting o’er their cups,</div>
<div class="i2">There’s poison in the draught.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And little know they of the fate</div>
<div class="i2">Poor Tea-leaf had to dree,</div>
<div class="i1">Or in their teapots they would weep</div>
<div class="i2">Tears bitter as their tea;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Till with the water of their woe</div>

<div class="i1">Then to poor Tea-leaf drop a tear,</div>

<p>Many short Parodies of Burns’s poems are scattered
about in various old periodicals, but comparatively few
are worthy of preservation, whilst some of the best,
which have appeared in Scotch newspapers, are so broad
in their dialect that few English readers would understand
them. Trading on this ignorance of the northern
dialect, some authors have composed poems, in imitation
of Burns, which, whilst retaining some of the sound,
contain none of the sense of the original.</p>

<p>A good example of this style of Parody is to be found

or, Centenary Celebration of the Birth of Robert Burns,<br />
held at the Crystal Palace, on January 25, 1859,</p>

<p>On November 9, 1858, the Directors of the Crystal
Palace Company published an advertisement, stating
their intention of celebrating the Centenary of the birth
of Robert Burns, by a grand festival at the Crystal Palace.
At the same time, they offered a prize of Fifty Guineas,
under certain conditions, for the best poem celebrating
the occasion, to be recited during the Festival, while they
solicited the loan of relics and memorials of the Poet,
which were to be exhibited on the occasion. An ample
response was made. On the 2nd of January, 621 poems
were collected, of which 9 came from America. Shortly
before this, the Directors had solicited Monckton Milnes,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, <abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr>, Tom Taylor, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, and Theodore Martin,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, to act as judges to award the prize; and these
gentlemen having kindly consented, commenced their
examination. In order to carry out the competition with
the utmost fairness, it was decided that the names of the
authors should not be communicated, but that two
mottoes should be inscribed, for identification, on each
poem, and that the name of the author should be forwarded
in a sealed envelope, which should bear corresponding
mottoes to the poem which it accompanied. The
Judges reported in favor of a poem bearing the mottoes
“<cite>Scots wha hae wi’ Wallace bled</cite>,” and “<cite>A man’s a’ man for
a’ that</cite>.” On the day of the Festival there was a large
attendance at the Crystal Palace, many interesting relics
and several portraits of Burns were exhibited, and there
was a concert of Scotch music, including many of Burns’s
own songs.</p>

<p>The late Mr. S. Phelps opened the sealed envelope,
and announced that the Prize poem was composed by a
lady, named “Isa Craig.” He then recited the ode
which, it must be confessed, was a somewhat disappointing
work, with little that was either distinctively Scotch,
or reminiscent of Burns in its composition. The poem
was printed in full in the Crystal Palace programme for
the day, also in the <cite>Times</cite>, of January 26, 1859.</p>

<p>That the Prize poem was unworthy of the occasion was
pretty generally admitted, the <cite>Times</cite> sneered at the whole
concern, principally because it was used by the C. P.
Company as an attraction to the Palace, though why that
should be a rebuke to managers of public entertainments
is not very clear. And, of course, as in the case of all
advertised poetical competitions, a collection of burlesque
poems was published about the same time as the Festival,
by Routledge, Warne and Routledge. This little volume
has since been assigned to the pen of Samuel Lover, and
it contains a few pieces of really smart, clever burlesque,
but the general effect is not very inspiriting. It is entitled:</p>

a statement that they were found in an old escritoire, and
are worthy of being preserved with the other relics of
Robert Burns.</p>

<p>Scotchmen are ever ready to do honour to the
memory of Burns, and enthusiastically celebrate
his birthday every year.</p>

<p>Last year the Aberdeen Burns Club had a
dinner at the Imperial Hotel, after which, one of
the members, Sir William Cadenhead read some
poems on Burns, purporting to have been composed
for the occasion by Lord Tennyson, Mr. Gladstone,
and Mr. Oscar Wilde.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these Parodies are too long to reproduce
here, but they may be found in <cite>The Aberdeen
Daily Free Press</cite>, of January 26, 1885.</p>

<span class="sc">he</span> immense popularity of the writings
of Sir Walter Scott is attested by the
number of Parodies and imitations
both in verse and in prose, they have
given rise to.</p>

<p>Thackeray’s well known burlesque continuation
of <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> entitled “<cite>Rebecca and Rowena</cite>” will be
fully described, with several others of a similar
nature, when dealing with prose parodies.</p>

<p>Several complete parodies of Scott’s poems
exist, such as <cite>Jokeby</cite>, <cite>The Lay of the Scotch Fiddle</cite>,
and <cite>Marmion Travestied</cite>, these are long, and rather
tedious, the topics touched upon being now somewhat
out of date. But there are many excellent
parodies of his shorter poems, and of detached
passages from <cite>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite>, etc.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the finest imitation of Sir Walter
Scott’s style is that contained in <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>,
the celebrated little volume by the Brothers James
and Horace Smith. Horace Smith was the author
of this imitation of Scott, a poem which was
especially singled out for praise by the reviewers.</p>

<p><cite>The Quarterly Review</cite> said “from the parody of
Walter Scott we know not what to select&mdash;it is all
good. The effect of the fire on the town, and the
description of a fireman in his official apparel, may
be quoted as amusing specimens of the <em>misapplication</em>
of the style and metre of Mr. Scott’s admirable
romances;” whilst <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite> spoke
of the poem as being admirably executed: “The
burning is described with the mighty minstrel’s love
of localities.” The authors of <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>,
in their very interesting preface to the eighteenth
edition, state that not one of those whom they had
parodied or burlesqued ever betrayed the least
soreness or refused to join in the laugh that they
had <span>occasioned:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“From Sir Walter Scott, whose transcendent talents
were only to be equalled by his virtues and his amiability,
we received favours and notice, which it will be difficult
to forget, because we had not the smallest claim upon his
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
kindness. ‘I certainly must have written this myself!’
said that fine-tempered man to one of the authors, pointing
to the description of the Fire, ‘although I forget upon
what occasion.’”</p>

he could, their very phrase.”&mdash;<span class="sc">Don Quixote.</span></p>

<div class="i1">For, rallying but to fall again,</div>
<div class="i3">He totter’d, sunk, and died!</div>
<div class="i1">Did none attempt, before he fell,</div>

<p>The above appeared in <cite>The Mirror</cite>, <abbr title="volume two">vol. II</abbr>, 1828, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 239.
About that period “intellectual females” were in fashion
as well as the Brobdignagian bonnets, mentioned in the
parodies on Burns. The origin of “Blue Stocking”
is given in Boswell’s Life of Johnson, edition 1835,
<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 8, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 85, “About this time (1781) it was much
the fashion for several ladies to have evening assemblies
where the fair sex might participate in conversation with
literary and ingenious men, animated by a desire to please.
These societies were denominated <cite>Blue Stocking Clubs</cite>; the
origin of which title being little known, it may be worth
while to relate it. One of the most eminent members of
those societies, when they first commenced, was Mr.
Stillingfleet, whose dress was remarkably grave, and in
particular it was observed that he wore blue stockings.
Such was the excellence of his conversation, that his
absence was felt as so great a loss, that it used to be said,
‘We can do nothing without the <em>blue stockings</em>;’ and thus
by degrees the title was established. Miss Hannah More
has admirably described a <cite>Blue Stocking Club</cite> in her ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bas
Bleu</i>,’ a poem in which many of the persons who were most
conspicuous there are mentioned.”</p>

<p>In “Reminiscences of the Court of Session (Scotland), as
it was a few years ago,” by George Outram, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, Advocate,
1856, there is a parody of “Mr. Kemble’s farewell
Address.” The subject of it is Mr. Patrick Robertson’s taking
leave of the Bar on his promotion to the Bench. “Before
assuming the judicial vestments, Robertson was entertained
at a farewell dinner by the sorrowing friends he was to leave
without the bar, and from whom he was henceforth by
judicial decorum to be separated. The following address
(written probably by either Douglas Cheape, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, Advocate,
or by the late Lord Neaves, one of the judges,) was prepared
to be spoken by the guest of the evening.”</p>

<div class="i1">If even in caution’s course I missed my aim,</div>
<div class="i1">Tried jokes by stealth, and blushed to find them fame&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The few preposterous efforts I have made</div>
<div class="i1">By this too partial tribute are repaid.</div>
<div class="i1">Could my big bosom prop the sinking line,</div>
<div class="i1">Then I could speak what feelings now are mine.</div>
<div class="i1">But fancy fails, expression dies away;</div>
<div class="i1">In feeble murmers I can only say,</div>

<p class="hanging">[“Mr. Gladstone, attired in a light summer suit, and without
any wrapper round his throat, walked on Tuesday
afternoon up Whitehall from his residence in Richmond-terrace.
On reaching Trafalgar Square the right <abbr title="honorable">hon.</abbr>
gentleman was closely followed by a considerable number
of people. He repeatedly raised his hat in acknowledgment
of the salutes he received from many persons as he
proceeded. Turning up the Strand, Mr. Gladstone made
his way in the direction of Covent Garden, still followed
by about a hundred persons.”&mdash;<cite>Daily News</cite>, July, 1885.]</p>

<div class="i1">The sun was hot, the day was bright,</div>
<div class="i1">The statesman found his collars tight;</div>
<div class="i1">He threw the starchy things aside,</div>

<div class="i1">In summer suit he quickly dressed&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">True Paisley cloth, and of the best,</div>
<div class="i1">Presented by admiring Scots</div>
<div class="i1">Who gave him presents, lots on lots.</div>
<div class="i1">“Ah, now,” he cried, in accents gay,</div>

<div class="i1">He first from Richmond Terrace hied,</div>
<div class="i1">Without policeman at his side;</div>
<div class="i1">And then up Whitehall took the air</div>
<div class="i1">Until he reached Trafalgar Square;</div>
<div class="i1">By twos and threes the folks came out</div>
<div class="i1">And welcomed Gladstone with a shout;</div>
<div class="i1">Others, attracted by the sound,</div>
<div class="i1">In tens and dozens gathered round;</div>
<div class="i1">Desiring but to be alone,</div>
<div class="i1">The baffled Statesman hurried on;</div>
<div class="i1">With eager steps he paced along,</div>
<div class="i1">But always followed by the throng;</div>
<div class="i1">He fled from crowded street to street,</div>
<div class="i1">Precipitately in retreat;</div>
<div class="i1">And yet, despite the pace he flew,</div>
<div class="i1">The crowd only the greater grew;</div>
<div class="i1">And now, though several days have gone,</div>
<div class="i1">That Statesman still is hurrying on;</div>
<div class="i1">And strangers in a London street</div>
<div class="i1">Perchance may any moment meet</div>
<div class="i1">An old man in a summer suit</div>
<div class="i1">Endeavouring to avoid pursuit,</div>
<div class="i1">But vainly; for where’er he goes</div>
<div class="i1">The crowd behind him cheers and grows.</div>

<p>This ballad is from <cite>The Lay of the Poor Fiddler</cite>, by an
admirer of Walter Scott. B. and R. Crosby &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>,
London, 1814.</p>

<p>This scarce little volume of 167 pages, is a tolerably
close Parody of “<cite>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite>.” It is, like
the original, in six Cantos, and is accompanied by
numerous notes, in which the legendary lore, and archæological
learning of Scott, are humourously and ingeniously
burlesqued.</p>

<p>The opening lines of each Canto are modelled upon
those of Scott’s poem, a few extracts may be <span class="lock">given:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">The night was dark, the wind did howl,</div>
<div class="i1">When Tom the Fiddler left his bowl;</div>
<div class="i1">His nose once of a fiery hue,</div>
<div class="i1">Was now deep tinged with modest blue;</div>
<div class="i1">Fierce o’er the heath the wind did blow,</div>
<div class="i1">And swiftly fell the drifting snow.</div>
<div class="i1">Tom was returning from the fair</div>
<div class="i1">With lightsome heart devoid of care;</div>
<div class="i1">His fiddle, as I’ve heard it sung,</div>
<div class="i1">Across one ample shoulder hung</div>
<div class="i1">In leathern case, and by his side,</div>
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
<div class="i1">A horn of snuff was well supplied;</div>
<div class="i1">A huge nob-stick he firmly grasped,</div>
<div class="i1">And to his breast a loaf he clasped,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Poor Tom had once seen better days</div>
<div class="i1">Than fiddling for a looby’s praise;</div>
<div class="i1">At country club, or wake, or fair,</div>
<div class="i1">He would have scorned to scrape a hair;</div>
<div class="i1">But now alas! old times are gone,</div>
<div class="i1">He roams neglected and unknown;</div>
<div class="i1">And strangers claim that high renown</div>
<div class="i1">Which Tommy once had thought his own.</div>
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>At length he reaches a large mansion, he craves admission
and shelter from the storm:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">The lady happened to be nigh,</div>
<div class="i1">She heard his voice and language high,</div>
<div class="i1">She marked his wet and dirty clothes,</div>
<div class="i1">His pimpled cheek and reverend nose,</div>
<div class="i1">And bade her maid the servants tell,</div>
<div class="i1">That they should use the fiddler well:</div>
<div class="i1">For she had known adversity,</div>
<div class="i1">Tho’ raised to such a high degree;</div>

<p>After due attention to the creature comforts of the
Fiddler, he obliges the company with his lay, in
the manner of Scott’s last Minstrel, and at the end of
each Canto refreshes himself with a draught of good
October ale. The opening lines of the third Canto
describe his partiality for strong <span class="lock">liquor:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Another imitation of <cite>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite> was
“<cite>The Lay of the Scottish Fiddle</cite>,” a poem in Five Cantos
(with notes in galore) supposed to be written by W&mdash;&mdash;.
S&mdash;&mdash;., <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, London, 1814. This parody was at first
attributed to the pen of Washington Irving, but is now
generally ascribed to his brother-in-law, James Kirke
Paulding, a voluminous author, well-known on the other
side of the Atlantic. The parody appears to have been
first published in the United States, and then re-produced
in London. The author, for the purpose of his
burlesque, describes the unhappy war then raging between
Great Britain and his own country, as predatory, and
treats of the British officers as border chieftains and freebooters.
Such poetical license, especially on the part of
an avowed foe, seems quite excusable, yet the Editor of
the English Edition, in his preface, is very severe both on
the poem and the notes which accompany it. These notes
are voluminous, occupying nearly as many pages as the
parody itself, and they are partly humorous and satirical,
but principally descriptive of events alluded to in the
poem, which had occurred during the war.</p>

<p>There were some imitations of Scott’s <cite>Lay</cite> in <cite>Truth</cite>,
January 18, 1877, and also in the Christmas number of
<cite>Truth</cite> for 1877.</p>

<p>“<cite>A Lay to the Last Minstrel</cite>,” inscribed to the memory
of Sir Walter Scott, by Edward Churton (London, John
Murray, 1874), is not, as one might suppose from the title,
either an imitation, or a parody of Scott. It is merely an
essay on his poetical genius, with some lines in his praise.</p>

<p class="center ls">MARMION.</p>

<p>This was the next poem published by Scott after
<cite>The Lay</cite>. It contains several passages which have
been singled out for frequent imitation, notably
Lady Heron’s Song, <cite>Lochinvar</cite>, and the well-known
lines in <span class="lock">Canto <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p  class="center"><span class="sc">The Prince of Wales’s Ride.</span></p>

<p  class="center">(à la Lochinvar.)</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales was present at the autumn manœuvres
in 1871, and the <cite>Times</cite> gave the following account of a part
he took in a sham <span class="lock">fight:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“A party of the dashing 10th Hussars had pushed on too
far up the hill, and were captured by our cavalry, and given
in as killed by an umpire. They were standing&mdash;dead men
all&mdash;on the ridge, when the Prince and his staff rode up the
hill-side, and made towards three of <span class="sc">Staveley’s</span> guns. In
a few seconds His Royal Highness had discovered whose
the guns were, and galloped up to the troop of the 10th, who
were prisoners (but he did not know it), placed himself at
their head, and ordered them to charge the guns. The
gunners, perceiving this manœuvre, with great smartness, but
little loyalty, put four rounds into the Prince and his Hussars
before they were ridden down. The Prince claimed the
battery, and an umpire was sent for. Sir <span class="sc">H. Grant</span>, Sir
<span class="sc">C. Staveley</span>, and others came, and the Prince and his party
were given in as prisoners; but when Sir <span class="sc">Charles</span> claimed
them, the Prince laughed and galloped off. Then was seen
the Heir Apparent, flying before a general of division and his
staff, who kept up the pursuit with a will, to loud cries of
“Stop him!” “Don’t let him go!” “Seize the Prince!”
One of Sir <span class="sc">Charles’s</span> aides-de-camp got so close that he
could have laid his hand on the Prince’s shoulder, but neither
for big guns, nor small arms, nor shouts would the Prince
draw bridle, and he got clear away, and vanished into the
woods below the hill.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Marmion Travesty.</span></p>

<p><cite>Marmion</cite> was published in February, 1808, when the Duke
of York was Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. A
scandal in connection with this office gave rise to a very
successful burlesque of <cite>Marmion</cite>, about which a few
explanatory notes must be given. Frederic, Duke of
York (the second son of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, born in 1763), having
proved his utter incapacity as a general in the field, during
several disastrous campaigns in Flanders and Holland,
was raised to the lucrative post of Commander-in-Chief of
the Army. Notwithstanding that he was married to a
daughter of the King of Prussia, he took several ladies
under his protection, one of whom, Mrs. Mary Anne Clarke,
was also married. The Duke, in addition to an unfortunate
attachment to the pleasures of the table, was also an
inveterate and unlucky gamester, consequently the allowance
of £1,000 a year which he had promised to Mrs.
Clarke was always in arrear.</p>

<p>Unable to support the expensive establishment which
she had started at the Duke’s instigations, Mrs. Clarke
proceeded, with much business aptitude, to sell Commissions
in the Army, to arrange promotions, and to
effect transfers, pocketing very large sums for her services,
which, in most cases, were crowned with success. Colonel
Wardle, <abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr> for Oakingham, brought the subject before
the House of Commons, an enquiry was instituted, Mrs.
Clarke was examined as a witness, and stated that she
always found the Duke of York willing to promote the
gentlemen whose names she recommended to his notice.
The evidence taken before the Committee was so damaging
to the character of the Duke that he resigned his office
before the House had fully decided on its report. Sir
David Dundas was appointed Commander-in-Chief, but
he only held the position for a short time. As soon as the
public indignation had in some degree subsided, the Duke
of York resumed the office, having by the clever ruse of a
temporary resignation, escaped the almost certain vote of
censure of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Upon these circumstances was founded “<cite>Marmion
travestied</cite>; a tale of Modern Times, by Peter Pry, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
London; Thomas Tegg, Cheapside. 1809.” The keynote
of this amusing volume is given by the motto, taken
from <span class="lock">Gay:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1"><cite>’Tis Woman that seduces all mankind;</cite></div>
<div class="i2"><cite>By her we first are taught the wheedling arts;</cite></div>
<div class="i1"><cite>Her very eyes can cheat when most she’s kind;</cite></div>
<div class="i2"><cite>She tricks us of our money with our hearts.</cite></div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The Travesty was inscribed by its author to “Walter
Scott, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, Advocate.” Each canto is introduced by
lines addressed either to Sir Francis Burdett, R. B.
Sheridan, Sir David Dundas, Sir Robert Peel, or Lord
Ellenborough.</p>

<p>The poem consists of 277 pages, octavo, and deals very
closely with the Clarke case, so that unless the reader has
by him the Report containing the evidence taken before
the House, some of the allusions would be unintelligible,
especially as the names are only indicated by italics, and
the volume is destitute of any explanatory notes.</p>

<p>As one of the longest and most important burlesques in
the language it could not be passed over, but unfortunately
it offers few passages, which detached from the context,
would interest the modern reader, and even these might
be considered rather broad in their allusions.</p>

<p>The parody it contains of Lady Heron’s song, <cite>Lochinvar</cite>,
is entitled “The Bishop,” an allusion to the fact that the
Duke of York was Prince-Bishop of Osnaburg, a post for
which his high moral character admirably fitted him.</p>

Walter Scott made the following sensible <span class="lock">remarks:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“If a man is determined to make a noise in the world, he
is as sure to encounter abuse and ridicule, as he who gallops
furiously through a village, must reckon on being followed
by the curs in full cry. Experienced persons know, that in
stretching to flog the latter, the rider is very apt to catch a bad
fall; nor is an attempt to chastise a malignant critic attended
with less danger to the author. <cite>On this principle I let parody,
burlesque, and squibs, find their own level</cite>; and while the
latter hissed most fiercely, I was cautious never to catch
them up, as school-boys do, to throw them back against the
naughty boy who fired them off, wisely remembering that
they are in such cases apt to explode in the handling.”</p>

<p>The philosophical temperament of which he here
boasts was soon put to a severe test, for George
Colman the younger produced a parody in which
every technical blemish in <cite>The Lady of the Lake</cite>
was mercilessly ridiculed, and every improbability
maliciously exaggerated, whilst Scott’s long Notes
on antiquarian and philological topics were imitated
with very comical mock gravity. This clever satire
was entitled, “<span class="sc">The Lady of the Wreck</span>; <cite>or
Castle Blarneygig</cite>,” by George Colman the younger,
inscribed to the author of “<cite>The Lady of the Lake</cite>.”
This poem was published by Longmans and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>,
London, and was illustrated by some curious and
very well executed little woodcuts. The scene of
the story is laid in Ireland, and the author thus
explains his reason for selecting that <span class="lock">country:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Let not the reader, whose senses have been delightfully
intoxicated by that Scottish <cite>Circe</cite>, the “<cite>Lady of the Lake</cite>,”
accuse the present author of plagiary. The wild Irish and
wild Caledonians bore a great resemblance to each other, in
very many particulars; and two Poets, who have any
“method in their madness,” may, naturally, fall into similar
strains of wildness, when handling subjects equally wild and
remote. ’Tis a wild world, my masters! The author of
this work has merely adopted the style which a northern
<span class="sc">Genius</span> has, of late, rendered the Fashion, and the <em>Rage</em>.
He has attempted, in this instance, to become a maker of the
<em>Modern-Antique</em>; a vendor of a new coinage, begrim’d with
the ancient ærugo; a constructor of <em>the dear pretty sublime</em>,
and <em>sweet little grand</em>; a writer of a short epick poem, stuff’d
with romantick knick-knackeries, and interlarded with
songs and ballads, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode de</i> Chevy Chase, Edom o’
Gordon, Sir Launcelot du Lake, &amp;c., &amp;c. How is such a
writer to be class’d?”</p>

<p>Scott’s descriptions of scenery, his love of sport,
and chivalrous tone are all, in this burlesque,
reduced to a very prosaic level; thus the lines in
Canto <span class="sc lowercase">I</span> <span class="lock">commencing:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Several other parts of this parody might be quoted,
but unfortunately Mr. Colman’s muse was not quite
so chaste as that of Walter Scott.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The libretto of an Italian opera was founded upon <cite>The
Lady of the Lake</cite> (and such librettos are always burlesques
on the original poem), besides which it has been frequently
represented, in various forms, on the stage. One
very amusing version, by Andrew Halliday, entitled
“<span class="sc">Mountain Dhu</span>; or, the Knight, the Lady, and the
Lake,” was produced at the Adelphi Theatre, on December
26, 1866. This burlesque was full of parodies of
Scotch songs with topical allusions. The leading parts
were performed by Mrs. Alfred Mellon, Miss Furtado,
and Paul Bedford, with J. L. Toole as Rhoderick Dhu.
About the same time Miss M. Oliver produced “<cite>The Lady
of the Lake</cite> plaid in a new Tartan, an ephemeral
burlesque,” by R. Reece, at the New Royalty Theatre,
London, but this was decidedly inferior in literary merit
to Mr. Halliday’s <cite>Mountain Dhu</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Jokeby</cite> went through many editions, although to a modern
reader it seems almost destitute of humour or talent. It has
been attributed to John Roby, and also to Thomas Tegg, its
publisher, whilst the Editor of <cite>Parodies</cite> copied the following
note from a copy of <cite>Jokeby</cite>, which had belonged to the late
Shirley Brooks, Editor of <cite>Punch</cite>:&mdash;“This was written by
the Brothers Smith (of Rejected Addresses). I picked it up
at a bookstall near Baker Street. The work is not good
for much, but I suppose is now scarce, so this may as well
be kept.&mdash;<cite>Shirley Brooks</cite>, 17th October, 1873.” But it
seems most improbable that this poor imitation should have
been the work of either of the Smiths, whose admirable
parody of Scott in the <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>, which was given
on page 72, shows what they could do in that way.</p>

<p>There was also <cite>Smokeby</cite> a Parody of the same poem,
which appeared in an early number of the <cite>Ephemerides</cite>, a
literary serial, published in Edinburgh in 1813. <cite>Rokeby the
Second</cite> is the title of a long, and rather dull, parody which
appeared in <cite>The Satirist</cite>, of March. 1813. The events
recounted in the poem are supposed to have occurred immediately
after the dreadful fight between Tom Cribb and
Molineux. The chief aim of this production was to
ridicule Scott for the inordinate length of the notes to his
poems, for in a preface entitled “An Essay on the Art of
Book Making,” the author remarks: “It must be known to
everyone, that in modern bookmaking, little depends on the
<em>poetry</em> of a <em>poem</em>. The notes are the thing on which success
depends. In these, difficult as it may seem to come up to
the authors of Childe Harold and Rokeby, I am vain enough
to think I shall not be found wanting.” Accordingly, the
notes are very long (as well as rather broad), and have very
little connection indeed with the parody itself.</p>

The Satirist, <cite>or Monthly Meteor</cite> (London), first appeared
on October 1, 1807, and was discontinued in 1814. It contained
numerous political parodies, and with each number
there was a large coloured folding cartoon. The tone of the
<cite>Satirist</cite> was decidedly Tory, and both in its cartoons and its
letterpress the Whigs were roundly abused and ridiculed.</p>

<p>The parts published December, 1808, and January, 1809,
contained two articles entitled “<cite>Second Sight</cite>,” which professed
to be a review of a new poem entitled “<span class="sc">MacArthur</span>,
<cite>an Epic Poem</cite>, in six Cantos, by Walter Scott, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>” This
review not only gave the plot of the supposed work, but also

<p>On the death of Mr. Henry James Pye, the Poet
Laureate, in 1813, and during the discussion which
ensued as to his probable successor, <cite>The Satirist</cite> published
a collection of applications for the post. These applications
(supposed to have been written by the most eminent
poets of the day), contained specimens of such odes and
addresses as they would have been prepared to manufacture
in praise of the monarch, and his family, on
appointment to the office. The authors thus parodied
were Hannah More, George Colman, Lord Byron, W.
Wordsworth, Thomas Campbell, Robert Southey, Walter
Scott, and George Crabbe. The notes which accompanied
the parodies were more interesting than the poems
themselves, of which, indeed, the only one which would
be worth quoting was a parody on Robert Southey. That
on Walter Scott was poor stuff, and most of the others are
quite out of date.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">The Poetic Mirror</span>, <cite>or the Living Bards of Britain</cite>,”
is the title of a small volume published by Longmans &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>,
London, in 1816. This contains poems which are ascribed,
in the index, to Lord Byron, Walter Scott, W. Wordsworth,
James Hogg, S. T. Coleridge, J. Wilson, and Robert
Southey. In the introduction the Editor remarks that he
claims no merit save that of having procured from the
authors the various Poems contained in the volume,
and he leads one to believe that the names affixed
to the Poems represent the real authors.</p>

<p>The Editor of <cite>Parodies</cite> purchased this little old book
in March, 1879, and by a singular coincidence he
picked up in the same shop “<cite>The Altrive Tales</cite>,” by the
Ettrick Shepherd (London, 1832). This contains a memoir
of the author, James Hogg, written by himself. In it
Hogg thus describes the origin of <cite>The Poetic Mirror</cite>:
“My next literary adventure was the most extravagant
of any. I took it into my head that I would collect a
poem from every living author in Britain, and publish them
in a neat and elegant volume, by which I calculated I might
make my fortune. I applied to Southey, Wilson, Wordsworth,
Lloyd, Morehead, Pringle, Paterson, and several
others, all of whom sent me poems. Wordsworth reclaimed
his, Byron and Rogers both promised, but neither of them
ever performed. Walter Scott absolutely refused to furnish
me with even one verse, which I took exceedingly ill, as it
frustrated my whole plan. I began, with a heavy heart, to
look over the pieces I had received, and lost all hope of the
success of my project. After considering them well, I
fancied that I could write a better poem than any that had
been sent to me, and this so completely in the style of each
poet, that it should not be known but for his own production.
It was this conceit that suggested to me the idea of “The
Poetic Mirror, or the Living Bards of Britain.” I wrote
nearly all of it in three weeks, and in less than three months
it was published. The second poem in the volume, namely,
the Epistle to R&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash; is not mine. It was written
by Mr. Thomas Pringle, and was not meant as an imitation
of Scott’s manner, although in the contents it is ascribed to
his pen. I do not set any particular value on any poem in
the work by myself, except “The Gude Greye Katte,”
which was written as a caricature of “The Pilgrims of the
Sun,” and some others of my fairy ballads. It is greatly
superior to any of them.”</p>

<p>It is only just to the memory of James Hogg to add that
the poems in the <cite>Poetic Mirror</cite> cannot be termed <cite>Parodies</cite>;
they are rather imitations of style, and all the authors
mentioned are treated with forbearance; Wordsworth, alone
comes in for some slight criticism, called forth by his intense
egotism, and offensive self-assertion, of which Hogg, in his
memoir, gives some amusing instances.</p>

<p>Besides the Epistle addressed to Southey, in the name of
Walter Scott, there is a long poem, in three Cantos, entitled
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
“<cite>Wat o’ the Cleuch</cite>,” which would pass very well as a minor
poem by Walter Scott himself. In style it somewhat
resembles <cite>Marmion</cite>, whilst <cite>Lochinvar</cite> was evidently in the
author’s mind when he wrote the following sketch of his
robber <span class="lock">hero:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Warreniana; <cite>with Notes Critical and Explanatory</cite>, by
the Editor of a Quarterly Review,” is the title of a small
volume of imitations, published by Longmans and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>,
London, in 1824. The Editor signs his prefatory remarks
“W.G.” but there is every reason to believe that the work
was written by a Barrister, Mr. William Frederic Deacon,
who died in, or about 1845. The motto on the title-page gives
the key-note to the motive of the poems, “<cite>I have even been
accused of writing Puffs for Warren’s Blacking</cite>,” <span class="sc">Lord Byron</span>.
Warren’s Blacking inspires each composition, but whether
seriously or in jest, can be best judged by the following
extract from the dedication to the King: “Deign then, oh
best of Princes, to justify the Editor’s appeal, that posterity
may learn how Warren enlarged the bounds of science,
and his Sovereign bowed approval. Long after the trophies
of a Wellington shall have floated down the Lethe of
oblivion, the name of Guelph, eternised by the gratitude
of Warren, shall flourish to after ages, the Medici of
modern art. That as yet this mighty manufacturer has
lived comparatively unnoticed, he casts no reflection on
your Majesty; he resigns that office to his Blacking, but
feels with the sensitiveness of neglected genius, that
intellect, like the oak, is but tardy in the attainment of its
honours.”</p>

<p>This dedication is followed by an introduction stating
that Robert Warren had lately engaged all the intellect of
England in his behalf, each author being required to
furnish a modicum of praise in the style to which he was
best adapted. The result being a collection of writings
attributed to Washington Irving, William Wordsworth,
Leigh Hunt, Robert Southey, Lord Byron, S. T. Coleridge,
Sir Walter Scott, and other authors of less note.</p>

<p>The imitation of Scott is <span class="lock">entitled:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Battle of Brentford Green.</span></p>

<p>“<cite>In the autumn of 1818, a serious affray took place between
those illustrious rivals, Warren, and Day and Martin. The
parties, as I learn from the black litter record of the fray, met
at Brentford, and after a ‘well-foughtenfield,’ victory was decided
in favour of the former Chieftain.</cite>”</p>

<p>The first Canto describes a Wassail in the banquetting-hall
of Robert Warren. The second Canto, which is
the better of the two, is <span class="lock">entitled:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 1822 a volume of Poems was published by Hurst,
Robinson and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, of London, and in Edinburgh by
Archibald Constable and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, entitled “<span class="sc">The Bridal of
Caölchairn</span>, <cite>and other Poems</cite>, by Sir Walter Scott, Bart.”</p>

<p>In the same year another edition was published by T.
Hookham, Old Bond Street, London, on the title-page of
which the work was said to be “by John Hay Allan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>”
The volume was dedicated to the Duke of Argyle, it had
no preface, nor any explanation of the author’s impudent
attempt to pass off his work upon the public as that of
Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>The poems are of a serious nature, and would not have
been mentioned here, had it not been for the hoax as to
their authorship.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>Rejected Odes</cite>, edited by Humphrey Hedgehog, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
(London, J. Johnston, 1813), contains an imitation of Scott’s
poetry, but it is not worth quoting.</p>

<p>When George, visited Scotland in August, 1822, Scott
wrote an imitation of an old Jacobite ditty, <cite>Carle, now the
King’s come</cite>, it was in two parts, and was published as a
broadside. This was parodied, under the title of <cite>Sawney,
now the King’s come</cite>, of which it is very difficult now to
obtain a copy.</p>

<p>In the third volume of the works of the late Thomas Love
Peacock (London, R. Bentley and Son, 1875) there is a
<cite>Border Ballad</cite> written in imitation of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>This was one of the “Paper Money Lyrics” which were
written by Peacock in 1825, and published in 1837, it has
little to interest modern readers.</p>

<p>Several other Parodies of Scott have appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>, in
addition to those here reprinted. One, entitled <cite>The Battle of
Wimbledon</cite>, which appeared on July 19, 1862, consists principally
of an enumeration of the most famous shots amongst
the Volunteers of the day. Another, <cite>The Nile Song</cite>, June 6,
1863, in imitation of “Hail to the Chief,” celebrates the
announcement made by Sir R. Murchison, at the Royal
Geographical Society that Messrs. Speke and Grant had
discovered the sources of the Nile.</p>

<p>A few other Parodies of detached passages of Scott’s
poems are to be found in the early numbers of Blackwood’s
Magazine, some of which were written by Professor Wilson
(Christopher North.)</p>

<p>Many of Scott’s novels have been dramatised, and also
burlesqued, these will be enumerated when dealing with his
prose works. It may here be mentioned, however, that a burlesque
of <cite>Kenilworth</cite>, written by R. Reece and H. B. Farnie
is now being performed at the Avenue Theatre, London.</p>

<p>The Temple Bar memorial, erected in the centre of a
narrow and very busy thoroughfare, cost London over
£12,000. So great was the annoyance it caused, both on
account of its obstruction and its ugliness, that two
policemen were placed to guard it night and day, yet, in
spite of their watchfulness, the carvings were smashed
wherever they could be reached. The grotesque Griffin
which surmounts the memorial is still the laughing stock
of every passer-by.</p>

<p>Dr. John Cumming, minister of the Scotch church, in
London, frequently introduced controversial matters into
his sermons, and was at times, rather violent in his denunciations
of the Pope, and Roman Catholicism. The Pope
wrote inviting him to go to Rome, but intimated that he
would not consent to reopen a discussion on theological
questions which had long since been decided by his august
predecessors. The two following parodies on the subject
appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>, which has always been exceedingly bitter
in its attacks on the Roman Catholics and their priesthood.
So much so that Richard Doyle (himself a Catholic), one
of the most talented artists who ever drew for <cite>Punch</cite>, retired
from its staff on that account.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Picked up in the Crowd</i>.)</p>

<p>An article, having the above title, appeared in the <cite>New
Monthly Magazine</cite>, July, 1831. It referred to the forthcoming
coronation of King William <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> and Queen
Adelaide, which took place on September 8, 1831. The
scraps of poetry were supposed to proceed from the pens of
Sir Walter Scott, Thomas Campbell, S. T. Coleridge,
W. Wordsworth, L.E.L. (Miss Landon), the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> G.
Crabbe, Thomas Moore, Thomas Hood, and Robert
Southey, then Poet Laureate. As the imitations of
Scott and Campbell lead the way, the article may as
well be inserted here. The little introductory notices
alluding to Moore’s well-known love of a Lord, Southey’s
objection to write the official odes hitherto expected from
the Poet Laureate, &amp;c., sufficiently indicate the authors
referred to. Some of the imitations are not very striking,
and those on Crabbe and L.E.L. might perhaps have been
omitted as possessing little to interest the modern reader.
However, the whole of the poetry is given, the comments
only having been slightly shortened.</p>

<p>[A tall “stalwart figure,” with a good-humoured Scotch
face, a sturdy-looking stick, and a style of dress indicative
of something between the farmer and the philosopher,
should be represented seated upon a pile of novels,
marked “fiftieth edition,” writing, with a pen in each
hand two volumes at once of a new work&mdash;at the same
time dictating a third to an amanuensis at his elbow.]</p>

initials “P.L.U.C.” He must be leaning on an anchor,
reading the last account of the capture of Warsaw. His
books must be numerous and classical, but none bound
in Russia, as it reminds him of despotism. A volume of
his own poems should be lying before him, opened at
“Hohenlinden,” as that exquisite composition has
evidently suggested the idea of his new one, called “The

<p>[The author of “The Ancient Mariner,” should be
delineated after the poet’s definition of him, as a “noticeable
man with small grey eyes.” A crowd of listeners
should be around him, catching up with eagerness and
ecstasy every syllable as it falls from his lips; and in a
corner of the room there might be one or two persons
reading his works, apparently puzzled at times to make
out his meaning. On the walls should be representations
of a giant devoting his life to catching flies; of a
philosopher straying on the sea-shore to pick up shells,
while the sails of the vessel that was to waft him to his
home are scarcely to be descried in the distance.]</p>

simplicity of character, an unaffected familiarity of
demeanour, and a suit of <em>brown</em>, properly fitted for one

<p>[The author of this “Reflection,” who would have

closed this Coronation, should be represented by a river
side, moralizing on the state of some Crabs that have just

which is washing over him. He should be figured as a
poet prone to consider things “too curiously”&mdash;as one
who, if he had a centipede to describe, would dissect you
every separate leg, and instruct you in its anatomy; who
would enlist your sympathies for a beggar by painting the
shape and colour of every patch upon his vest, and whose
picture of a battle would be merely the Army-List turned
into rhyme. A workhouse should be in the centre of the
picture, with a prison on one side, and an hospital on the

<div class="i2">Were nothing but jelly, no will of their own,</div>

<div class="i2">And turned o’er their “Dictions,” so ragged and brown.</div>
<div class="i1">For men must work and give up their sleep,</div>
<div class="i1">Their livings to earn and themselves to keep,</div>

<p class="center">“<span class="sc">Blow, Blow, Thou Wintry Wind.</span>”</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have lived to see and hear a great many strange
things, but I never expected to live to hear an English poet
singing the praises of the North-East Wind, as I am
amazed to find the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Kingsley has been doing.
What does the man mean? Has he a nerve in his body?
Is he susceptible of catarrh, influenza, bronchitis, and the
other ills that miserable flesh is heir to in this climate?
Has he a constitution of cast iron, a skin of triple brass, and
muscles of steel wire? Does he not know what it is, as he
lies in bed of a morning, to feel that twinge of indescribable
all-overishness, which announces that the East Wind is
blowing outside the house? Does he not feel his eyes
smart, his skin scorch and shrivel, his every limb ache,
appetite go, and his temper break down altogether, whenever
this same abominable wind prevails, as it does three
days out of four in this infernal climate of ours?</p>

<p>Sir, if we are to have a song of the North East Wind, I
submit that mine is more the thing than Mr. Kingsley’s, and
therefore beg to enclose it for your journal, which has occasionally,
though at distant intervals, beguiled a miserable

Clock.</span>&mdash;(To the Editor of the <cite>Daily News</cite>.)&mdash;Sir,&mdash;The
writer of an article in your edition of to-day, in quoting these
lines of Kingsley’s: ‘Oh, blessed south-west train; Oh,
blessed, blessed Speaker’s clock, All prophesying rain,’
describes them as being ‘rather mysterious.’ As it is quite
unusual to see anything of Kingsley’s thus characterised, it may
perhaps be instructive to your writer, and interesting to your
readers, to know that these lines simply have reference to
the sounds which were wafted towards Eversley Rectory
from the South-Western Railway and the clock at Heckfield
Place, the residence of the then Speaker of the House of
Commons, when the ‘bless’d southwind’ was blowing;

<div class="i2">I cried, “Hang her sweet pretty face!”</div>

<div class="i1">Still, we went here and there,&mdash;right and left, boys;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">We were asked dozen’s deep,&mdash;I say “we,”</div>
<div class="i1">Though wherever I went not a soul, boys,</div>
<div class="i2">Could have pointed out Adam from <em>me</em>.</div>
<div class="i1">But we had a rare social success, boys,</div>
<div class="i2">Got mixed with the noble and great,</div>
<div class="i1">Till one’s friends, who say kind and nice things, boys,</div>
<div class="i2">Talked of me as “the man come to wait!”</div>

<div class="i1">So, I’ve no more a sweet pretty wife, boys;</div>
<div class="i2">For the one that I once hoped to own,</div>
<div class="i1">Belongs, as I’ve found to my cost, boys,</div>
<div class="i2">To the great British public alone.</div>
<div class="i1">So until they’ve got tired of her face, boys,</div>
<div class="i2">And a rival more touzled or curled,</div>

<p>Paragraphs have recently appeared in the
London newspapers announcing that a public
company has been formed to provide the metropolis
with improved cabs. It is to be hoped the
news is true, for whilst similar announcements have
been often made before, the London four-wheeled
cab remains, what it was described by <cite>Punch</cite> in
1853, the worst public vehicle to be found in any
large European city.</p>

<div class="i1">Yet beautiful and bright he stood</div>
<div class="i2">As born to rule the storm;</div>
<div class="i1">A creature of heroic blood,</div>
<div class="i2">A proud though child-like form!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The flames rolled on&mdash;he would not go</div>
<div class="i2">Without his father’s word;</div>
<div class="i1">That father faint in death below,</div>
<div class="i2">His voice no longer heard.</div>
<div class="i1">He called aloud&mdash;“Say, father, say.</div>
<div class="i2">If yet my task is done!”</div>
<div class="i1">He knew not that the chieftain lay</div>
<div class="i2">Unconscious of his son.</div>

<div class="i1">“Speak, father!” once again he cried,</div>

<div class="i2">And fast the flames rolled on.</div>
<div class="i1">Upon his brow he felt their breath,</div>
<div class="i2">And in his waving hair;</div>
<div class="i1">And looked from that lone post of death</div>
<div class="i2">In still, yet brave despair!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He shouted yet once more aloud,</div>
<div class="i2">“My father! must I stay?”</div>
<div class="i1">While o’er him fast, through sail and shroud,</div>
<div class="i2">The wreathing fires made way:</div>
<div class="i1">They wrapped the ship in splendour wild.</div>
<div class="i2">They caught the flag on high,</div>
<div class="i1">And streamed above the gallant child,</div>
<div class="i2">Like banners in the sky.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then came a burst of thunder sound&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The boy&mdash;oh! where was he?</div>
<div class="i1">Ask of the winds, that far around</div>
<div class="i2">With fragments strewed the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">With mast and helm and pennon fair,</div>

<p>“The boy stood on the back-yard fence whence all but he
had fled. The flames that lit his father’s barn shone just
above the shed. One bunch of crackers in his hand, two
others in his hat; with piteous accent loud he cried, ‘I never
thought of that.’ A bunch of crackers to the tail of one
small dog he tied; the sparks flew wide, and red, and hot;
they fell upon the brat; they fired the crackers in his hand
and lit those in his hat. Then came a burst of rattling
sound&mdash;the boy, where was he gone? Ask of the winds
that far around strewed bits of flesh and bone, and scraps of
clothes, and balls, and tops, and nails, and books, and yarn,
the relics of that dreadful boy that burned his father’s
barn.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The “Three Acres and a Cow” Legend.</span></p>

<p>The familiar joke, that every labourer was
promised three acres and a cow, arose, as myths
usually arise, out of an inversion of actual facts.
Nobody ever seriously believed that such promises
were made, and everybody knows that the substratum
of truth on which the misrepresentation
rested was that some machinery must be set up to
promote the restoration of the people to the soil.
There was, however, no desire to injure the landowners.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain speaking at the Westminster
Palace Hotel, in January, 1886, observed <span class="lock">that:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Tories have universally asserted that we promised
to every labourer, as a free gift, three acres of land and a
cow. (Laughter.) Well, I don’t think the labourers are
fools. They have not shown it at the last election; and I
don’t suppose many of them have been deceived by this
falsehood. I sometimes think we were a little too eager to
contradict it. (Laughter.) At all events, if we see it necessary
to repudiate this burlesque of our intentions and our
promises, let us take care to do nothing to discourage the
expectation, perfectly praiseworthy and reasonable in itself,
that facilities should be made by legislation for every thrifty,
industrious labourer to obtain at a fair price an adequate,
independent, and secure interest in the soil which he
cultivates.”</p>

<p><cite>The Globe</cite>, (London), in an article on <cite>The Three
Acres Legend</cite>, <span class="lock">observed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Whether anybody ever said, in jest or earnest, that Mr.
Chamberlain had promised three acres and a cow to every
elector who voted Liberal, we do not know. But someone
has been writing to him to ask whether such a statement,
supposing it to have been made, would be true, and the
inquirer has received the answer which he might have looked
for. The statement is not true. Mr. Chamberlain’s secretary
goes on to suggest to the right <abbr title="honorable">hon.</abbr> gentleman’s correspondent
that he has only to challenge those who make the
assertion to prove it by quotation, adding, that if they decline
the challenge he will know how to deal with them. He will,
in fact, be able to charge them with uttering falsehoods.”</p>

<div class="i1">Three Freshers went sailing out into the street,</div>
<div class="i2">Out into the street for a ‘town and gown,’</div>
<div class="i1">Each thought of the foeman he longed to meet</div>
<div class="i2">And the Bull-dogs stood watching them out in the town.</div>
<div class="i1">Through ‘High’ and ‘Broad’ the Proctor must sweep,</div>
<div class="i1">And the fifth of November is hard to keep</div>
<div class="i2">When such myrmidons are roaming.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Three times that night near the Magdalen tower,</div>
<div class="i2">Did the dim gas lamps show a ‘town and gown’;</div>
<div class="i1">They looked out for squalls, but alas! for the hour</div>
<div class="i2">That the Proctor came up and was neatly knocked down;</div>
<div class="i1">For men their hands from Proctors must keep</div>
<div class="i1">Though blows be sudden, and black-eyes cheap,</div>
<div class="i2">When our gallant blades are roaming.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Three heroes set out for their native strands,</div>
<div class="i2">When the morning gleam saw them all ‘sent down.’</div>
<div class="i1">And the tradesmen of Oxford are wringing their hands</div>
<div class="i2">For those who may never come home to the town.</div>
<div class="i1">And Fathers storm, and Mothers must weep,</div>
<div class="i1">And the Freshers have sworn a great oath they will keep</div>
<div class="i2">Of goodbye to the fifth and its roamings.</div>

<span class="sc">lthough</span> this voluminous author was
Poet-Laureate from 1813 until his death,
and produced a great quantity of poetry,
yet only a very few of what he would
have considered his minor poems, ever achieved
any success. Of his more ambitious works, some of
which contain passages of undoubted power and
originality, even the very names are now generally
forgotten, or only remembered in connection with
the Satires and Lampoons of his political adversaries.
Southey commenced life as an ardent
Republican, and wrote poems which were ridiculed
by Tories such as George Canning; he concluded
by becoming a Tory himself and was mercilessly
satirised by Whigs, such as Byron and Macaulay.
It will therefore be necessary to divide the parodies
of his poems into three distinct classes, the non-Political,
the early Political, and the later Political.
Of Southey’s non-political poems the best
known are “<cite>The Cataract of Lodore</cite>,” “<cite>The Battle</cite>
<cite>of Blenheim</cite>,” and “<cite>You are Old Father William</cite>,”
of each of which there are many amusing parodies.
But before treating of these a few imitations of
detached passages taken from Southey’s epic
poems may be given. These epics were never
very popular, and are now almost forgotten, yet
they contain some beautiful descriptive poetry, as
for instance the opening lines of “<cite>Thalaba the</cite>
<span class="lock"><cite>Destroyer</cite>”:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Of all the amusing poems in <cite>The Rejected
Addresses</cite> perhaps the only one which can be truly
styled a <em>parody</em> is <cite>The Rebuilding</cite>, which closely
mimics the Funeral of Arvalan in Southey’s <cite>Curse of
Kehama</cite>. Not only is the metre closely followed,
but James Smith, the author of this particular
“Address,” has shown great ingenuity in bringing
in the same characters as Southey has introduced
into his poem. Lord Jeffrey, writing in <cite>The Edinburgh
Review</cite>, said, “<cite>The Rebuilding</cite> is in the name
of Mr. Southey, and is one of the best in the collection.
It is in the style of the Kehama of that
multifarious author, and is supposed to be spoken
in the character of one of his Glendoveers. The
imitation of the diction and measure, is nearly
perfect; and the descriptions are as good as
the original.” It may here be mentioned that
Southey borrowed his description of the Glendoveers
from the “Life and Adventures of Peter
Wilkins,” published in London, in 1751.</p>

<div class="i4">It is! it is! Yamen, thine hour is nigh:</div>
<div class="i6">Like as an eagle claws an asp,</div>
<div class="i2">Veeshnoo has caught him in his mighty grasp,</div>

<div class="i2">To earth by the laws of attraction he flew,</div>
<div class="i7">And he fell, and he fell</div>
<div class="i7">To the regions of hell;</div>
<div class="i2">Nine centuries bounced he from cavern to rock,</div>
<div class="i1">And his head, as he tumbled, went nickety-nock,</div>
<div class="i5">Like a pebble in Carisbrook well.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Now Veeshnoo turned round to a capering varlet,</div>
<div class="i4">Array’d in blue and white and scarlet,</div>
<div class="i2">And cried, “Oh! brown of slipper as of hat!</div>

<div class="i2">He seized the wooden sword, and smote the earth;</div>
<div class="i5">When lo! upstarting into birth</div>
<div class="i6">A fabric, gorgeous to behold,</div>
<div class="i6">Outshone in elegance the old,</div>
<div class="i1">And Veeshnoo saw, and cried, “Hail, playhouse mine!”</div>
<div class="i4">Then, bending his head, to Surya he said:</div>
<div class="i7">“Soon as thy maiden sister Di</div>

<div class="i4">And through the fissures of her clouded fan</div>
<div class="i6">Peeps at the naughty monster man</div>
<div class="i9">Go mount yon edifice,</div>
<div class="i8">And show thy steady face</div>
<div class="i9">In renovated pride,</div>
<div class="i4">More bright, more glorious than before!”</div>
<div class="i5">But ah! coy Surya still felt a twinge,</div>
<div class="i5">Still smarted from his former singe;</div>
<div class="i8">And to Veshnoo replied,</div>
<div class="i9">In a tone rather gruff,</div>
<div class="i4">“No, thank you! one tumble’s enough!”</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">It chanced that at an old tobacconist’s,</div>
<div class="i1">Outside the door a painted figure stood,</div>
<div class="i1">A Kilted Scotchman neatly carved in wood;</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas new and rather good.</div>
<div class="i1">Now Tomkins bent upon a spree,</div>
<div class="i1">Walked down the street the various sights to see;</div>
<div class="i1">But when the painted image Tomkins view’d,</div>
<div class="i2">To this he sprung, to this he clung,</div>
<div class="i1">And ran like mad along the High with this</div>
<div class="i2">Across his shoulder swung.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Two bobbies seized him as he turned the street,</div>
<div class="i2">Before he was aware;</div>
<div class="i1">He dropped the image, and with wingèd feet</div>
<div class="i2">Shinned them, and bolted like a started hare;</div>
<div class="i1">The angry bobbies baffled now,</div>
<div class="i1">Unto each other vow</div>
<div class="i2">To make it hot for any gownsmen there</div>
<div class="i1">They meet; and Wilkins passing, full of fun,</div>
<div class="i2">Began to chaff the bobbies; wrathful they</div>
<div class="i2">Seized him instead, and carried him away;</div>
<div class="i1">He neither struggled, kicked, nor tried to run,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor the least show of opposition made,</div>
<div class="i1">Although they grasped him with their dirty hands</div>
<div class="i2">Courageously, for they don’t feel afraid</div>
<div class="i1">When still their victim stands.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Thus are they always bold when they have made</div>
<div class="i2">Some crippled beggar old,</div>
<div class="i1">Or unresisting girl, or boy, their prey,</div>
<div class="i1">But somehow they are never in the way</div>
<div class="i2">If a strong ruffian has been throwing stones,</div>
<div class="i1">Or punching some one’s head in self-sought fray,</div>
<div class="i2">For they are careful of their bones.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“The culprit hath escaped,” the bobbies cried,</div>
<div class="i1">He hath escaped, but one is here,</div>

<div class="i1">Now let us go and tell</div>
<div class="i1">The Proctor that ’twas he; and so they went</div>
<div class="i2">And told their story well.</div>
<div class="i1">Next morning Wilkins gets a note,</div>
<div class="i2">Brought by the Proctor’s man,</div>
<div class="i1">To call upon the Proctor at his rooms</div>
<div class="i2">With all the haste he can.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">And when he came within the Proctor’s room,</div>
<div class="i2">Young Wilkins roused himself,</div>
<div class="i2">And told the Proctor ’twas a lie,</div>
<div class="i1">Invented by those blue-clad menials base;</div>
<div class="i2">That he was in the ‘High’</div>
<div class="i1">Walking alone, and never even saw</div>
<div class="i1">The wooden figure that they talked about.</div>
<div class="i2">And that these bobbies</div>
<div class="i1">Came and pounced on him as he walked about,</div>
<div class="i2">Because the real culprit they</div>
<div class="i1">Had been so baulked about.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">The velvet-sleeved one deigned him no reply,</div>
<div class="i1">The narrow-minded man&mdash;his gooseberry eye</div>
<div class="i1">Looked idiotic: not the smallest part</div>
<div class="i1">Had right and justice in his foolish heart.</div>
<div class="i1">At last he uttered loud each measured word,</div>
<div class="i2">Long in his breast confined,</div>
<div class="i1">Unjust, severe, proctorial, absurd&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The index of his mind.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i5">“You must go down,</div>
<div class="i5">Away from this town,</div>
<div class="i5">For here you would</div>
<div class="i5">Never do any good.</div>
<div class="i5">You have made a row,</div>

<div class="i6">You’ll not get back.</div>

<div class="i6">My words are plain,</div>
<div class="i6">You must never again,</div>
<div class="i6">Though it gives you pain,</div>
<div class="i6">Come up to Oxford.</div>
<div class="i5">If you think to do so,</div>
<div class="i6">You think it in vain,</div>
<div class="i5">You’ll have to obey me,</div>
<div class="i6">Mr. Wilkins, for ever:</div>
<div class="i5">You can go away now, Sir,</div>
<div class="i6">And return again never.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">There with those bugbears of the town</div>
<div class="i2">Before him, stood the wretched man;</div>
<div class="i1">There stood young Wilkins with loose-hanging gown.</div>
<div class="i2">Was it a dream? Ah! no,</div>
<div class="i2">He heard his sentence flow,</div>
<div class="i1">He heard the ready bobbies lie,</div>
<div class="i1">And felt all hope within him die.</div>
<div class="i2">Ah! who could have believed</div>
<div class="i2">That he the velvet-sleeved</div>
<div class="i1">Could have so small, so weak a mind,</div>
<div class="i2">And ever trust those worms of dust,</div>
<div class="i1">Those banes of student kind.</div>
<div class="i2">With indignation flashing from his eye,</div>
<div class="i1">He left the room, nor cast one look behind.</div>

<div class="i4">Playing at tickling,</div>
<div class="i4">Love verses writing,</div>
<div class="i4">Acrostics inditing,</div>
<div class="i4">If your finger aches, fretting,</div>
<div class="i4">Fondling and petting,</div>

<div class="i4">“Petseying,”&mdash;“wetseying,”</div>
<div class="i4">Now sighing, now dying,</div>

<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
<div class="i4">Now fingers squeezing or playfully teazing,</div>
<div class="i4">Bringing you bull’s eyes, casting you sheep’s eyes,</div>
<div class="i4">Looking in faces while working braces;</div>
<div class="i4">Never once heeding what they are reading,</div>
<div class="i4">But soiling one’s hose by pressing one’s toes;</div>
<div class="i1">Or else so zealous, and nice, and jealous of all the fellows,</div>
<div class="i1">Darting fierce glances, if ever one dances, with a son of France’s;</div>
<div class="i1">Or finding great faults, and threatening assaults whenever you “Valtz;”</div>
<div class="i1">Or fuming and fussing enough for a dozen if you romp with your cousin;</div>
<div class="i1">Continually stopping, when out-a-shopping, and bank notes dropping,</div>
<div class="i1">Not seeking to win money, calling it “tin” money, and promising pin-money;</div>
<div class="i1">Liking picnics at Twickenham, off lovely cold chicken, ham and champagne to quicken ’em;</div>
<div class="i1">Detesting one’s walking without John too goes stalking, to prevent the men talking;</div>
<div class="i1">Think you still in your teens, wont let you eat “greens,” and hate Crinolines;</div>
<div class="i1">Or heaping caresses, if you curl your back tresses, or wear low-neck’d dresses;</div>
<div class="i1">Or when up the river, almost sure to <em>diskiver</em> that it beats all to shiver the sweet Guadalquiver;</div>
<div class="i1">Or seeing death-fetches if the toothache one catches, making picturesque sketches of the houses of wretches;</div>
<div class="i1">Or with loud double knocks bring from Eber’s a box, to see “<span class="sc">Box and Cox</span>,” or pilfer one’s locks to mark their new socks;</div>
<div class="i1">Or, whilst you are singing a love song so stinging, they vow they’ll be swinging, or in serpentine springing, unless to them clinging your’ll go wedding-ringing, and for life mend their linen.</div>
<div class="i1">Now the gentlemen sure I’ve no wish to disparage,</div>
<div class="i1">But this is the way they go on <em>before</em> marriage.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><span class="sc">After.</span></div>
<div class="i4">How do they do after marriage?</div>
<div class="i4">Oh, then nothing pleases ’em,</div>
<div class="i4">But everything teases ’em;</div>
<div class="i4">Then they’re grumbling and snarling&mdash;</div>
<div class="i4">You’re a “fool,” not a “darling”;</div>
<div class="i4">Though they’re rich as the <em>Ingies</em>,</div>
<div class="i4">They’re the stingiest of stingies;</div>
<div class="i4">And what is so funny,</div>
<div class="i4">They’ve <em>never</em> got money;</div>
<div class="i4">Only ask them for any</div>
<div class="i4">And they haven’t a penny;</div>
<div class="i4">But what passes all bounds,</div>
<div class="i4">On themselves they’ll spend pounds&mdash;</div>
<div class="i4">Give guineas for lunch</div>
<div class="i4">Off real turtle and punch;</div>
<div class="i1">Each week a noise brings about, when they pitch all the things about</div>
<div class="i2">Now bowing in mockery, now smashing the crockery;</div>
<div class="i2">Scolding and swearing, their bald heads tearing,</div>
<div class="i2">Storming and raging past all assuaging.</div>
<div class="i1">Heaven preserve us! it makes one so nervous,</div>
<div class="i1">To hear the door slam to, be called simple ma’am too:</div>
<div class="i1">(I wonder if Adam called Mrs. Eve <em>Madam</em>;)</div>
<div class="i1">As a matter of course they’ll have a divorce;</div>
<div class="i1">Or “my Lord Duke” intends to send you home to your friends;</div>
<div class="i1">Allow ten pounds a quarter for yourself and your daughter;</div>
<div class="i1">Though you strive all your might you can do nothing right;</div>
<div class="i1">While the maids&mdash;the old song&mdash;can do nothing wrong;</div>
<div class="i1">“Ev’ry shirt wants a button”! Every day they’ve cold mutton;</div>
<div class="i1">They’re always a-flurrying one, or else they’re a-hurrying one, or else they’re a-worrying one;</div>
<div class="i1">Threatening to smother your dear sainted mother, or kick your big brother;</div>
<div class="i1">After all your fine doings, your strugglings and stewings&mdash;why “the house is in ruins!”</div>
<div class="i1">Then the wine goes like winking, and they cannot help thinking you’ve taken to drinking;</div>
<div class="i1">They’re perpetually rows keeping, ’cause out of house-keeping they’re in bonnets their spouse keeping;</div>
<div class="i1">So when they’ve been meated if with pies they’re not treated, they vow that they’re cheated;</div>
<div class="i1">Then against Ascot Races, and all such sweet places, they set their old faces;</div>
<div class="i1">And they’ll never leave town, nor to Broadstairs go down, though with bile you’re quite brown;</div>
<div class="i1">For their wife, they unwilling are, after cooing and billing her, to stand a cap from a Milliner&mdash;e’en a paltry twelve shillinger;</div>
<div class="i1">And it gives them the vapours to witness the capers, of those bowers and scrapers the young linen drapers;</div>
<div class="i1">Then to add to your woes, they say nobody knows how the money all goes, but they pay through the nose for the dear children’s clothes;</div>
<div class="i1">Though you strive and endeavour, they’re so mightily clever, that please them you’ll never, till you leave them for ever!&mdash;Yes! the hundredth time sever&mdash;“<em>for ever and ever</em>”!!</div>
<div class="i1">Now the gentlemen sure I’ve no wish to disparage,</div>
<div class="i1">But this is the way they go on <em>after</em> marriage.</div>

<div class="i2">Why, I do it again and again.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,</div>

<div class="i2">Pray, <em>what</em> is the reason of that?”</div>

<div class="i1">“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</div>

<div class="i2">Allow me to sell you a couple.”</div>

<div class="i1">Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak,</div>
<div class="i2">Pray how did you manage to do it?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,</div>
<div class="i2">And argued each case with my wife,</div>
<div class="i1">And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,</div>
<div class="i2">Has lasted the rest of my life.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose,</div>
<div class="i2">That your eye was as steady as ever,</div>
<div class="i1">Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose,</div>
<div class="i2">What made you so <em>awfully</em> clever?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I have answered three questions and that is enough,”</div>
<div class="i2">Said his father. “don’t give yourself airs,</div>

<p>(Few are aware that Southey’s beautiful and much lauded
Poem of “Old Father William,” is copied almost
verbatim from an old American ballad. Far be it from us
to comment upon the fact, but truth compels us to remark
that a more barefaced piece of plagiarism has never come
under our notice. In order to convince the public of the
veracity of our statements, we subjoin the original ballad as
found by us in an old MS. entitled “Wild Cat Warblings.”)</p>

<div class="stanza">

<p>Mr. J. Dixon, in a recent number of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>,
remarks that “while writing this popular little poem
Southey seems to have ‘forgotten his history’ in making
Caspar, an old Bavarian peasant, call Prince Eugene of
Savoy, “<em>our</em> good prince.” He and the Duke of Marlborough,
as commanders of the allied forces, defeated
the combined army of the French and Bavarians, and old
Caspar could look upon Prince Eugene only as an enemy
and alien. Southey calls the little boy <em>Peterkin</em>, a name
quite unknown in South Germany. <em>Blenheim</em> has been so
universally accepted as giving a name to the battle, and
so many places in England have been called after it, that
it would be absurd to expect that the real name of the
village&mdash;‘Blindheim’&mdash;should ever replace it; but certain
it is that no such place as <em>Blenheim</em> exists in Germany.”</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">PARODIES OF SOUTHEY’S EARLY
POLITICAL POEMS.</p>

<p>In order to explain the parodies of Southey’s political
poems, it is necessary to refer to the peculiar opinions he
held, and the widely varying theories he advanced, at
two different periods of his life.</p>

<p>In Southey’s youth his friends had wished him to enter
the English Church, but he, in addition to holding
strong republican views, had also imbibed Socinian principles.
Feeling, therefore, that he could neither conscientiously
receive holy orders, nor remain happily under a
purely monarchical government, he decided upon resigning
both his college and his country. He enlisted his two
bosom friends, Lovell and Coleridge, in his projects, and,
proceeding to Bristol, there held a consultation as to the
best mode of securing the liberties of the human race in
future, from the designs and ambition of political rulers.
The system agreed upon was that of a Pantisocracy, or
society wherein all things should be in common; and the
spot fixed on as the citadel of future Freedom was on the
banks of the river Susquehana, in North America.</p>

<p>But the poverty of the three friends prevented them
from putting the scheme into execution, and procuring, as
they had fondly hoped, universal liberty and equality for
the entire human race.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this disappointment Southey’s enthusiasm
in the cause of republicanism was kindled even
higher than before; and, in his “Wat Tyler,” published in
1795, he advocated the principle of universal liberty and
equality, with a fervour not exceeded by any writer of that
agitated period. This vehemence, he lived to regret,&mdash;whether
the calmer judgment of maturer years condemned
the errors of those that were past,&mdash;or whether
self-interest was the influencing motive for a sudden and
total change of political sentiment, it is not now possible
to ascertain. So complete was his change of sentiment
that he employed the most active measures for the
suppression of the work itself: he destroyed all the unsold
copies, bought up many of those that had been distributed,
and exhibited the plainest demonstration of an abandonment
of his early projects and principles. Carlisle, and
others, who did not hesitate to expose themselves to legal
penalties, provided they could hold up a political deserter
to public scorn, had the boldness to republish “Wat
Tyler” without Mr. Southey’s permission. An injunction
was instantly applied for by the indignant author, but
Lord Eldon refused to grant this protection, on the plea
that “a person cannot recover damages upon a work which
in its nature was calculated to do injury to the public.”
This decision encouraged the vendors of the poem, and
not less than 60,000 copies are supposed to have been sold
during the excitement it created. And such passages as
the following were extracted from it, and widely quoted by
the opposition <span class="lock">journals:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“My brethren, these are truths, and weighty ones.</div>
<div class="i1">Ye are all equal: Nature made ye so,</div>
<div class="i1">Equality is your birth-right;&mdash;when I gaze</div>
<div class="i1">On the proud palace, and behold one man</div>
<div class="i1">In the blood-purpled robes of royalty,</div>
<div class="i1">Feasting at ease, and lording over millions;</div>
<div class="i1">Then turn me to the hut of poverty,</div>
<div class="i1">And see the wretched labourer, worn with toil,</div>
<div class="i1">Divide his scanty morsel with his infants;</div>
<div class="i1">I sicken, and, indignant at the sight,</div>
<div class="i1">Blush for the patience of humanity.”</div>

<p>Nor had Southey the consolation of public sympathy,
which indeed is seldom shown to such political apostates.</p>

<p>Henceforward Southey cast off his revolutionary opinions,
and all his future writings were marked by an intolerant
attachment to church and state, and servile
adulation of the Royal Family. He soon reaped the
reward of his apostacy, he was appointed secretary to Mr.
Corry, Chancellor of the Exchequer for Ireland, with a
salary of £350 a year, and very light duties. In 1807, the
government conferred a pension of £200 a year upon him,
and in 1813, on the death of Henry James Pye, he was
appointed Poet Laureate. In this capacity he did not
compose the usual Birthday odes, and New Year’s Day
odes, as had been done by his predecessors, but he produced
various courtly poems on certain important events.
These appeared at irregular intervals, and there are only
three which need be specially alluded to, namely, <cite>Carmina
Aulica</cite>, written in 1814, on the arrival of the allied
sovereigns in England; <cite>Carmen Triumphale</cite> for the commencement
of the year 1814; and <cite>Carmen Nuptiale</cite>, the Lay
of the Laureate on the marriage of the Princess Charlotte.
But last, and worst of all, was <cite>The Vision of Judgment</cite>,
written on the death of George <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>, in 1820. These
poems were all deeply tinged with Southey’s political prejudices,
and contained the most bitter sentiments towards
all who differed from his views; they provoked much animosity
and ridicule at the time, and would soon have
passed into utter oblivion, but for the satires and parodies
they gave rise to.</p>

<p>Of these Lord Byron’s <cite>Vision of Judgment</cite> was, of course,
the most powerful, in it the Laureate received a mercilessly
witty castigation, which even his admirers admitted to be
not altogether unmerited, as he had gone out of his way to
attack those who had done him no wrong.</p>

<p>The mere fact of Southey’s complete change of opinions
on political and social affairs would not, in itself, have been
sufficient to account for the violence of the attacks to
which he was subjected. It was not only that he turned
from being an ardent Republican and a Communist, to a
staunch Royalist and supporter of the Aristocratic form of
government, but the change came at a time when party
feeling ran very high, when the great body of the people
were suffering sore distress, and when his own prospects,
pecuniary and social, were greatly benefitted by deserting
what was then known as the popular cause.</p>

<p>Further, he at once proceeded with all the ardour of a
pervert to violently attack all who held similar views to
those he had but so lately upheld, and advised that the most
severely repressive measures should betaken against them,
which caused Byron to address him thus, in the opening
lines of <cite>Don Juan</cite>:</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the attacks aimed at him, Southey
continued to write in the interest of his patrons, and retained
the office of Poet Laureate until his death in 1843, when
it was conferred upon William Wordsworth, who already
held a lucrative government appointment. For more
complete details of the duties and emoluments connected
with the post of Poet Laureate, readers may refer to my
little history of the Poets Laureate of England.</p>

<p>The most witty and amusing attacks of Southey’s early
republican poems proceeded from the pen of George
Canning who started the <cite>Anti-Jacobin Review</cite>, a series of
weekly papers, the avowed object of which was to expose
the doctrines of the French Revolution, and to ridicule the
advocates of that event, and the friends of peace and parliamentary
reform. The editor was William Gifford,
author of the <cite>Baviad and Mæviad</cite>, and John Hookham
Frere, Lord Clare, and Lord Mornington, were amongst
the contributors. Their purpose was to disparage and
blacken their adversaries, and they spared no means in the
attempt. Their most distinguished countrymen, whose
only fault was their being opposed to the government,
were treated with no more respect than their foreign
adversaries, and were held up to public execration as
traitors, blasphemers, and debauchees. So alarmed,
however, became some of the more moderate supporters
of the ministry at the violence of the language employed,
that Mr. Pitt was induced to interfere, and after an
existence of eight months, the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite> (in its
original form) ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The Poetry which appeared in the <cite>Anti-Jacobi</cite>n has
been frequently reprinted, but the prose contents are now
generally forgotten. The best of the poetry was contributed
by George Canning, with some assistance from
John Hookham Frere, and whilst ridiculing the utopian
views of Southey, and his friends, with much point and
spirit, it differed from the prose articles of the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite> in
that it contained fewer insulting personal allusions, and
was generally written in a style of good humoured banter.</p>

<p>It was in November, 1797, that the first parody on
Southey appeared, founded upon the following</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Inscription.</span></p>

<p>In the next number of the <cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite> there was an
article on <span class="sc">Jacobin Poetry</span>, in which it was stated that
“one of the most universally recognised principles in the
Jacobin creed was that the truly benevolent mind should
consider only the <em>severity of the punishment inflicted by human
law</em>s without any reference to the <em>malignity of the crime</em>. It
remained only to fit it with a poetical dress, which had been
attempted in the inscription for Chepstow Castle, and which
(we flatter ourselves), was accomplished in that for Mrs.
Brownrigg’s cell.”</p>

<p>“Another principle, no less devoutly entertained, and no
less sedulously administered, is the <em>natural and eternal warfare
of the Poor and the Rich</em>.”</p>

<p>“This principle is treated at large by many authors, we
trace it particularly in a poem by the same author from
whom we borrowed our former illustration of the Jacobin
doctrine of crimes and punishments. In this poem, the
pathos of the matter is not a little relieved by the absurdity
of the metre. The learned reader will perceive that the
metre is sapphic, and affords a fine opportunity for his
<span class="sc lowercase">SCANNING</span> and <span class="sc lowercase">PROVING</span>, if he has not forgotten <span class="lock">them”:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SOUTHEY’S OFFICIAL POEMS.</p>

<p>Southey wrote an ode on the first overthrow of
Napoleon, entitled “<cite>Carmen Triumphale</cite>, for the
year 1814,” this gave James Hogg, the Ettrick
Shepherd, the hint for a long and uninteresting
parody “<cite>The Curse of the Laureate, Carmen Judiciale</cite>,”
published in “The Poetic Mirror,” in 1816.</p>

<p>But of all Southey’s official poems “<cite>The Vision
of Judgment</cite>,” published in 1820, on the death of
George <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>, was the most important, and the one
which received the greatest attention, praise, blame,
and ridicule from his contemporaries, according to
their various shades of opinion.</p>

<p>There are two notable instances in English
literature of the respect described as having been
paid by heaven to deceased kings. The first of
these was the tribute paid by the servile Dryden to
the memory of Charles <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, entitled “<cite>A Funeral
Pindarique poem, sacred to the Happy Memory of
King Charles <abbr title="Two">II</abbr></cite>,” the other was the description,
by Robert Southey, of the beatification of George
<abbr title="Three">III</abbr>, entitled “<cite>The Vision of Judgment</cite>.”</p>

<p>Of Dryden’s poem nothing need here be said,
except that it contained the oft quoted <span class="lock">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“For, e’er a prince is to perfection brought,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>He costs omnipotence a second thought</em>.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Second thoughts are not always the best, and
few kings have been above the average of mankind.</p>

<p>At the time these poems were written each author
was enjoying the pension of Poet Laureate, which
furnishes the only possible excuse for the blasphemy,
and the fulsome adulation, which characterise the
poems.</p>

<p>Southey’s poem, with all its faults, was scarcely so
glaringly profane at that of Dryden, who spoke of
the <em>second</em> Charles, as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">That all-forgiving king,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>The type of him above</em>!</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">yet Southey did not hesitate to represent the
Almighty as leaving his throne especially to come
down to meet the spirit of George <abbr title="Three">III</abbr> at the gate of
heaven. Then all the spirits in heaven, and in hell,
are summoned to the trial of the old king, and his
accusers are ordered to stand forth to bear
witness against him.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Southey this immaculate king
had no accusers save two from amongst the fiends,
and they are too terrified by his presence to bear
witness against him. These are the shades of
<em>Junius</em> and <em>John Wilkes</em>, both of whom are immediately
hurled away into sulphurous darkness.</p>

<p>After this George <abbr title="Three">III</abbr> is told by an angel that
“<cite>there is none to arraign him</cite>,” which is scarcely
surprising considering the summary manner in
which Southey had disposed of the previous accusers.</p>

<p>The beatification of George follows, and he
makes his triumphal entry into heaven, according
to Southey, as the <span class="sc">King of Glory</span>! The poem
was written in blank verse, and consisted of twelve
cantos, whereas Lord Byron’s <cite>Vision of Judgment</cite>
is written in rhyme, and can scarcely be styled
a parody of Southey’s <cite>Vision</cite>. It is, besides, a
rather lengthy production, and as every one has a
copy of Byron’s works, it is unnecessary to insert
it here. In his preface, Byron alludes to the inconsistencies
of Southey’s life and opinions, and in
the poem itself he causes Southey thus to describe
his works to the Arch-angel Michael:</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1821, William Hone issued a pamphlet
entitled “<span class="sc">A Slap at Slop</span>, <cite>and the Bridge Street
Gang</cite>,” with some clever political caricatures by
George Cruikshank. This pamphlet contains
several amusing parodies, notably one on Canning’s
<cite>U</cite>-niversity <cite>of Gottingen</cite>, and a very close imitation
of part of Southey’s “<cite>Vision of Judgment</cite>.”</p>

<p>Hone’s object was not only to ridicule Southey’s
poem, but also to attack the members of <cite>The Loyal
Association</cite>, or, as it was afterwards styled, “The
Constitutional Association,” a body formed with
somewhat similar objects to those of <cite>The Primrose
League</cite> of to-day. This society had its offices in
New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, hence Hone’s term,
“<cite>Bridge Street Gang</cite>,” its secretary was one Charles
Murray, a thin, elderly man with a wooden leg;
whilst “Dr. Slop” was a name borrowed by Hone
from <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite>, and applied to Sir John
Stoddart, M.D., a choleric physician, who had formerly
been on the staff of <cite>The Times</cite> newspaper. He
had therein attacked certain persons, and opinions,
so intemperately that he was discharged, according
to an article in <cite>The Times</cite> itself, in 1817, on account
of “the virulence and indiscretion of his articles.”</p>

<p>He then started a journal of his own, called <cite>The
New Times</cite>, in which the objects and proceedings of
“The Constitutional Association” were constantly
puffed and praised. Hone christened this paper,
with doubtful taste, “The Muck Times, or Slop-pail,”
and in the following parody he imitates Southey’s
description of the hosts assembled in heaven to welcome
George <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>, amongst whom only those were
named whose political opinions were pleasing to
the Poet Laureate.</p>

<div class="i1">’Twas at that sober hour when the light of day is receding,</div>
<div class="i1">I alone in <span class="sc">Slop</span>’s office was left; and, in trouble of spirit,</div>
<div class="i1">I mused on old times, till my comfort of heart had departed.</div>
<div class="i1">Pensile at least I shall be, methought&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sus per coll.</i> surely!</div>
<div class="i1">And therewithal felt I my neckcloth; when lo! on a sudden,</div>
<div class="i1">There came on my eyes, hanging midway ’twixt heaven and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s,</div>
<div class="i1">The book called the Pension List. There did I see my name written.</div>
<div class="i1">Yea even in that great book of life! It was sweet to my eye-lids.</div>
<div class="i1">As dew from a tax! and <em>Infinity</em> seem’d to be open,</div>
<div class="i1">And I said to myself. “Now a blessing be on thee, my Robert!</div>
<div class="i1">And a blessing on thee too my pen! and on thee too my sack-but!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, as thus I was standing, mine ear heard a rap at the street-door,</div>
<div class="i1">Ev’n such as a man might make bold with, half gentle, half footman;</div>
<div class="i1">And lo! up the stairs, dotting one, one, after the other,</div>
<div class="i1">Came the leg of a wonder, hop! hop! through the silence of evening</div>
<div class="i1">And then a voice snarling from the throat of him they call <span class="sc">Murray</span>,</div>
<div class="i1">Who said, as he hopp’d, “must the <cite>Muck Times</cite> be mournful at <em>all</em> times?</div>
<div class="i1">Lo, <span class="sc">Slop</span>, I’ve a sop, for your mop; yes&mdash;hop! hop! I’ve a <em>story</em>,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Don’t be so <em>bold</em>!” methought <em>a larking</em> voice from the skylight</div>

<div class="i1">Knowing not why, or how, my soul seem’d night-cap to my body.</div>
<div class="i1">Then came again the voice, but then with a louder squalling&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Go to <span class="sc">Hell</span>” said the voice, “What, I?” said I inwardly, “I go?”</div>
<div class="i1">When lo, and behold, a great wonder! I, I, <span class="sc">Robert Southey</span>,</div>

<div class="i1">But the <em>Owner</em> thereof was a glorified spirit above,</div>

<div class="i1">And <em>in Torment</em> (but here the blest rage of the bard returns on me)</div>
<div class="i1">And in torment was <em>She</em>, who, on earth, had been also tormented</div>
<div class="i1">By <em>Him</em> who is never, nor can be accused, of aught <em>vicious</em>;</div>
<div class="i1">With her were the friends of my childhood&mdash;not leaving out <em>Coleridge</em>;</div>
<div class="i1">And they who were <em>killed</em> by the Manchester Yeomanry also;</div>
<div class="i1">And <em>Truth</em>, the whole Truth, nothing <em>but</em> the Truth, suffered the burning.</div>
<div class="i1">Then I turn’d my meek eyes, in their gladness, to Heaven, and my <em>place</em> there,</div>
<div class="i1">And ascending, I flew back to Paradise, singing of Justice;</div>
<div class="i1">Where, fill’d with divine expectation of merited favour,</div>
<div class="i1">The gathering host look’d to him, in whom all their hopes center’d,</div>
<div class="i1">As the <em>everlasting</em> hand; and I, too, press’d forward to obtain&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">But old recollections withheld me; down, down, dropped my sack-but,</div>
<div class="i1">And my feet, methought slid, and I fell precipitate. Starting,</div>
<div class="i1">Then I awoke, with my hair up, and lo! my young days were before me,</div>
<div class="i1">Dark yet distinct; but instead of the voice of the honest,</div>
<div class="i1">I heard only Murray’s <em>Yap! yap!</em> and <em>hop! hop!</em> through the silence of evening:</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Yap! hop!</em> and <em>hop! yap!</em> and hence came the hop, step, and jump of my verses.</div>

<div class="i1">I ordered my boots for a walk, my boots that polished and pointed,</div>
<div class="i1">Bright on their surface display the beauty of Warren’s jet blacking:</div>
<div class="i1">Now you must know that my man, in his speed to reply to my summons,</div>
<div class="i1">Brought me my Wellington boots, but never once thought of the boothooks;</div>
<div class="i1">So to allay my spleen by calm and ennobling reflections,</div>
<div class="i1">Such as might wile the time disturb’d by my valet’s omission,</div>
<div class="i1">I sate me down in a chair, and thus apostrophised Warren.</div>
<div class="i1">“Pontiff of modern art! whose name is as noted as mine is,</div>
<div class="i1">Noted for talent and skill, and the cardinal virtues of manhood</div>
<div class="i1">Receive this tribute of praise from one whose applause is an honour,</div>
<div class="i1">I am he who sang of Roderick, the last of the Goths, and</div>
<div class="i1">Gothic enough it was, I’m told, in metre and meaning;</div>
<div class="i1">Thalaba too was mine, that wild and wondrous effusion,</div>
<div class="i1">Madoc and Joan of Arc, and the splendid curse of Kehama;</div>
<div class="i1">If I then, the author of these and other miraculous volumes,</div>

<div class="i1">Already I hear thy puffs discussed in the circle at Almack’s,</div>
<div class="i1">Dusking with sable shade the light of the Scotch Ariosto</div>
<div class="i1">Already I hear them arranged for the violincello by Smart, and</div>
<div class="i1">Melting on syren lips in lieu of Italian bravuras:</div>
<div class="i1">Braham at Drury Lane, the Stephens at proud Covent Garden,</div>
<div class="i1">Dwell on each soul stirring rhyme as a lover dwells on the moonlight,</div>

<div class="i1">She waltzes with twinkling twirl, and butterfly bucks hover round her;</div>
<div class="i1">Thee she hails as a friend, while her pumps, in the pride of their polish,</div>
<div class="i1">Illumine the ball-room floor like the slippers of famed Cinderella,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In Brighton thy name is known, and waxeth important at Cheltenham;</div>
<div class="i1">Travels <em>per coach</em> to Bath, that exceedingly beautiful city;</div>
<div class="i1">Thence crossing the channel to Wales, it stirs up attention at Swansea;</div>
<div class="i1">Or flees with the speed of a dove o’er the mountainous ridges of Snowden,</div>
<div class="i1">Till valley, and rock, and glen ring aloud with ‘Buy Warren’s Blacking.’</div>
<div class="i1">“But not unto Britain alone is thy fame, Robert Warren, confined: o’er</div>
<div class="i1">The civilised regions of Europe, believe me, ’tis equally honoured;</div>
<div class="i1">For when, as a proof of the fact, I rambled through Switzerland lately;</div>
<div class="i1">And, spent with the labour of travel, put up in the vale of Chamouny,</div>
<div class="i1">My boots by the waiter were bathed in the luminous dew of thy blacking:</div>
<div class="i1">This, as you well may guess, astonished my nerves not a little;</div>
<div class="i1">So, flaming with zeal, I said, ‘now tell me, oh waiter, I pray thee,</div>
<div class="i1">Th’ extent of this tradesman’s fame in the vales of the Switzer, that straight I</div>
<div class="i1">May note it down as a hint for some future edition of travels,</div>
<div class="i1">Then blythe the waiter assured me that through Chamouny, the splendour</div>
<div class="i1">Of Warren’s name beamed joy, as the snow on the summit of Jura,</div>
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
<div class="i1">Tinged by the occident ray, sheds glory and gladness around it,</div>
<div class="i1">While villages bask in its smiles:&mdash;meantime I continued my Carmen,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Thrice honoured artist, who hast a minstrel like me to commend thee!</div>
<div class="i1">Year upon year may roll, but you never will get such another;</div>
<div class="i1">For I am the bard of time, the puffer of peer or of peasant,</div>
<div class="i1">Whether Russ, German, or French, Whig, Radical, Ultra, or Tory,</div>
<div class="i1">Provided my <em>sack-butt</em> is paid with a <em>butt of sack</em> for each bouncer</div>
<div class="i1">Hence, nobles are proud to bow to my laurelled head at Saint James’s,</div>
<div class="i1">Deeming his Majesty’s grace dispensed through me, for they well know</div>

<div class="i1">Here I concluded my stave, for my valet returned with my boot-hooks;</div>
<div class="i1">So taking my hat in my hand a remarkably requisite practice,</div>
<div class="i1">I sought that widening gulf where the Strand with a murmur susurrous</div>
<div class="i1">Flows into Pall Mall East, like Thames at the Nore into ocean;</div>
<div class="i1">Here I stood rapt awhile, commending the buildings around me,</div>
<div class="i1">Especially Waterloo Place, with which I was highly delighted;</div>
<div class="i1">Till hearing the clock strike eight, I returned to my Strand habitation,</div>

<p class="p2 center">THE ANTI-JACOBIN.</p>

<p>As the early poems of Robert Southey were repeatedly
parodied in this celebrated journal, a few
words as to its contents may conveniently be inserted
here. “<cite>The Anti-Jacobin, or Weekly Examiner</cite>,”
was edited by W. Gifford, and the
principal contributors to its pages were the Rt.
Hon. George Canning, Mr. John Hookham Frere,
Mr. Jenkinson (afterwards Earl of Liverpool), Mr.
George Ellis, Lord Clare, Lord Mornington (afterwards
Marquis Wellesley), and Dr. John Whittaker.
The Poems in <cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> were not exclusively
political, and the following is a list of all that
can be properly termed Parodies, omitting only
those which have already been included in the
collection of Parodies on Southey.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>La Sainte Guillotine</cite>, a new song attempted from the
French. (<cite>Tune</cite>&mdash;“O’er the vine-covered hills and gay
regions of France.”)</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>The Progress of Man</cite>, a Didactic poem. Written to ridicule
Mr. R. Payne Knight’s <cite>The Progress of Civil Society</cite>, a
Didactic Poem.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>Chevy Chase</cite>, a parody founded upon the Duke of Northumberland’s
attempt to evade the payment of Income Tax.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>The Loves of the Triangles</cite>, a parody of Dr. Darwin’s <cite>Loves
of the Plants</cite>.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>Brissot’s Ghost</cite>, a parody on Glover’s Ballad of <cite>Admiral
Hosier’s Ghost</cite>.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>Ode to Jacobinism</cite>, a political parody of Gray’s <cite>Hymn to
Adversity</cite>.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>The Jacobin</cite>, a political skit, written in imitation of
Southey’s Sapphics, but not so good as the examples already
quoted, and dealing with obsolete facts and forgotten
individuals.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>Ode to a Jacobin</cite>, in imitation of Suckling’s <cite>Ode to a Lover</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>The Anti-Jacobin</cite> also contained several humorous
imitations of Horace, and a burlesque play,
founded on some German dramas, translations of
which were then being performed in England to
the detriment, and discouragement of English
dramatists. The greater portion of this amusing
work was written by Canning, it was entitled “<cite>The
Rovers; or, the Double Arrangement</cite>,” and has
passages which parody <cite>The Robbers</cite>, and several
other plays by Schiller: <cite>Stella</cite> by Goethe, and
<cite>Count Benyowsky, or, the Conspiracy of Kamschatka</cite>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Rovers.</span></p>

<p>The second scene of the first act contains the
gem of the burlesque. It opens <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="stagedirection">Scene changes to a subterranean vault in the Abbey of Quedlinburgh
with coffins, escutcheons, death’s heads, and cross-bones,&mdash;toads
and other loathsome reptiles are seen traversing
the obscurer parts of the stage.</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Rogero</span> <span class="stagedirection">appears, in
chains, in a suit of rusty armour, with his beard grown, and
a cap of a grotesque form upon his head&mdash;beside him a crock,
or pitcher, supposed to contain his daily allowance of
sustenance.&mdash;A long silence, during which the wind is heard
to whistle through the caverns.</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Rogero</span> <span class="stagedirection">rises, and comes
slowly forward, with his arms folded.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Rogero.</span> Eleven years! it is now eleven years since I
was first immured in this living sepulchre, the cruelty of a
Minister&mdash;the perfidy of a Monk&mdash;yes, Matilda! for thy
sake&mdash;alive amidst the dead&mdash;chained&mdash;coffined&mdash;confined&mdash;cut
off from the converse of my fellowmen. Soft! what
have we here? (<span class="stagedirection">stumbles over a bundle of sticks.</span>) Oh! the
register of my captivity. Let me see; how stands the
account? Eleven years and fifteen days!&mdash;Hah! the twenty-eighth
of August! How does the recollection of it vibrate
on my heart! It was on this day that I took my last leave
of my Matilda. Some demon whispered me that I should
never see her more.… Soft, what air was that!
it seems a sound of more than human warblings. Again,
(<span class="stagedirection">listens attentively for some minutes.</span>) Only the wind; it is
well, however; it reminds me of that melancholy air, which
has so often solaced the hours of my captivity. Let me see
whether the damps of this dungeon have not yet injured my
guitar.</p>

<p class="blockquote">(<span class="stagedirection">Takes his guitar, tunes it, and begins the following air</span>,
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
<span class="stagedirection">with a full accompaniment of violins from the orchestra.
Air, Lanterna Magica.</span></p>

against the walls of his prison; and finally so hard as to

<p>There is a curious circumstance connected with
the composition of this song, the first five stanzas
of which were written by Mr. Canning. Having
been accidentally seen, previous to its publication,
by Mr. Pitt, who was cognisant of the proceedings
of the “<cite>Anti-Jacobin</cite>” writers, he was so amused
with it, that he took up a pen, and composed the
last stanza on the spot. As the song has been so
frequently parodied any detail connected with it is
interesting, and it may be remarked that Mr. Pitt
fell into a grave error in describing <i>Rogero</i> as
doomed to starve on water gruel, for in the previous
scene the waiter mentions that he had just
conveyed the usual dinner to the prisoner in the
vaults, namely, pease-soup, with the scrag end of a
neck of mutton.</p>

<p>From <cite>Hone’s Facetiæ and Miscellanies</cite>. <cite>A Slap at Slop</cite> by
William Hone, with illustrations by G. Cruikshank. <i>London</i>,
1822.</p>

<p>The allusions to Dr. Slop, (Dr. John Stoddart,) and the
<cite>Constitutional Association</cite>, or Bridge Street Gang, have already

<p>In 1826 a party who believed that the home
and university plan of education which prevails in
Scotland, was much better than the college and
university education of Oxford or Cambridge, made
Lord Brougham and Mr. Charles Knight their
spokesmen, and declared they would have a university
within reach of their own homes. A joint-stock
company was formed, and the place in Gower
Street was opened on October 1, 1828, under the
name of the “London University.” One very
prominent feature in the prospectus was that there
should be perfect religious freedom within the
university. The scheme met with much opposition
and ridicule, Theodore Hook dubbed the place
“Stinkomalee,” and R. Harris Barham, the author
of the Ingoldsby Legends, satirised it in the following
amusing <span class="lock">parody:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The “Union” is a well known Club for Oxford
Students, having reading and smoking rooms, a
good library, and a debating room, in which some
of our finest public speakers have made their maiden
efforts. The frescoes above referred to were painted
in 1857 by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and are, unfortunately,
rapidly fading away.</p>

<p>There was another Oxford parody of this song in

<h3 class="h3head">Algernon Charles Swinburne</h3>

<p class="center smaller">ON</p>

<p class="center">MR. GLADSTONE AND HOME RULE.</p>

<p>During the recent election <cite>The Times</cite> newspaper
was strongly opposed to Mr. Gladstone’s policy,
and on July 1, 1886, it published a poem by A. C.
Swinburne, entitled “<cite>The Commonweal</cite>” to which
it thus solemnly drew attention in its leading
<span class="lock">article:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“None can accuse Mr. Swinburne of sympathy with
oppression, or with failure to champion the cause of struggling
nationalities. But he is clear-sighted enough to see on
which side in this struggle lie the great interests of human
liberty, and the vigorous poem which we print to-day from
his pen is a worthy contribution to the battle now being
waged. “See the man of words embrace the man of
blood”&mdash;points an alliance which English Liberals may well
blush to acknowledge; and an appeal to all that is sound in
this nation cannot better end than in Mr. Swinburne’s
<span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i2">Men, whose brothers met rebellion face to face,</div>
<div class="i1">Shew the hearts ye have, if worthy long descent and high communion,</div>
<div class="i2">Shew the spirits, if unbroken, of your race.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">2.</div>
<div class="i1">What are these that howl and hiss across the strait of westward water,</div>
<div class="i2">What is he who floods our ears with speech in flood;</div>
<div class="i1">See the long tongue lick the dripping hand that smokes and reeks of slaughter!</div>
<div class="i2">See the man of words embrace the man of blood!</div>
<div class="poemdivider">3.</div>

<div class="i1">Till disunion bring forth union, what is union, Sirs, but paper?</div>
<div class="i2">Break and rend it, then shall trust and strength increase.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">4.</div>
<div class="i1">Who would fear to trust a double-faced but single-hearted dreamer,</div>

<div class="i2">I am old&mdash;when young men yell at me, I smile.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">5.</div>
<div class="i1">Many a year that priceless light of life has trembled, we remember,</div>
<div class="i2">On the platform of extinction&mdash;unextinct;</div>
<div class="i1">Many a month has been for him the long year’s last&mdash;life’s calm December:</div>
<div class="i2">Can it be that he who said so, saying so, winked?</div>
<div class="poemdivider">6.</div>
<div class="i1">No: the lust of life, the thirst for work and days with work to do in,</div>
<div class="i2">Drove and drives him down the road of splendid shame;</div>
<div class="i1">All is well, if o’er the monument recording England’s ruin</div>
<div class="i2">Time shall read, inscribed in triumph, Gladstone’s name.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">7.</div>
<div class="i1">Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies,</div>

<div class="i1">What if yesterday their hearts recoiled from blood and fraud and crime?</div>
<div class="i2">Conscience erred&mdash;an error which to-day repairs.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">9.</div>
<div class="i1">Conscience only now convinces them of strange though transient error:</div>
<div class="i2">Only now they see how fair is treason’s face;</div>
<div class="i1">See how true the falsehood, just the theft, and blameless is the terror,</div>
<div class="i2">Which replaces just and blameless men in place.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">10.</div>
<div class="i1">Place and time decide the right and wrong of thought and word and action;</div>
<div class="i2">Crime is black as hell, till virtue gain its vote;</div>
<div class="i1">Then&mdash;but ah, to think or say so smacks of fraud or smells of faction:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Mercy holds the door while Murder hacks the throat.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">11.</div>
<div class="i1">Murder? Treason? Theft? Poor brothers who succumb to such temptations,</div>
<div class="i2">Shall we lay on you or take on us the blame?</div>
<div class="i1">Reason answers, and religion echoes round to wondering nations,</div>
<div class="i2">“Not with Ireland, but with England rests the shame.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">12.</div>

<div class="i2">Such deliverance as our daring brought on him.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">14.</div>
<div class="i1">“Far and wide the world rings record of our faith, our constant dealing,</div>

<div class="i1">Sign once more the bond of trust in us that here awaits but sealing,</div>
<div class="i2">We will give yet more than all our record shows.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">15.</div>
<div class="i1">“Perfect ruin, shame eternal, everlasting degradation,</div>

<p>The next day <cite>The Daily News</cite>, which was in
favor of Mr. Gladstone’s policy of Home Rule for
Ireland, published a parody of the poem, and, in
one of its articles, alluded to Mr. Swinburne in the
following terms of <span class="lock">reproach:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Every topic of prejudice is being urged by the opponents
of Home Rule. All the sins of the Irish people, all the
errors of their leaders, are being daily enumerated by critics
who have made it their business to stir up international hatred
between the two countries as the best means of consolidating
union. The latest ally of the Tories is a red republican,
who happens also to be the foulest-mouthed and foulest-minded
poet of the age. Mr. Swinburne is alleged by Mr.
Theodore Watts to be a man of genius, and he has unquestionably
a marvellous command of rhythmical and sonorous
verse. But the words in which he attacks Mr. Gladstone
are faint and feeble when compared with the language in
which he has previously inveighed against Christianity,
morality, and Almighty God.”</p>

<div class="i1">Such causes long are championed amidst slander, shame, and sorrow,</div>

<p>The heroine of this poem died in London ten or twelve
years ago. For some time previously she had been in poverty
and when, about 1870, a subscription was started for her,
Gounod composed an air to Byron’s “Maid of Athens”
which produced about £20 towards the fund for the benefit
of Mrs. Black, as she then was. It is said that Lord Byron
wrote the poem in Athens, about 1810, when he was quite a
young man, but I have never yet seen any mention made of
the wonderful similarity between it, and the following ballad
which appeared in <cite>The Monthly Mirror</cite>, November <span class="lock">1799:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center ls">DRURY-LANE THEATRE.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August, 1812, the following advertisement
appeared in most of the daily <span class="lock">papers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center small">“<cite>Rebuilding of Drury-Lane Theatre</cite>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Committee are desirous of promoting a free and
fair competition for an Address to be spoken upon the
opening of the Theatre, which will take place on the 10th
of October next. They have, therefore, thought fit to
announce to the public, that they will be glad to receive
any such compositions, addressed to their Secretary, at
the Treasury-office, in Drury-Lane, on or before the 10th
of September, sealed up, with a distinguishing word,
number, or motto, on the cover, corresponding with the
inscription on a separate sealed paper, containing the
name of the author, which will not be opened unless containing
the name of the successful candidate.”</p>

<p>Many addresses were sent in, but the Committee
rejected them all, much to the annoyance of the competitors,
who, having expended their time and paper, by
the implied engagement on the part of the committee that
the best bidder should have the contract, had a right to
protest against the injustice of this wholesale rejection.
The committee made an absurd engagement; but surely
they were bound to keep to it.</p>

<p>In the dilemma to which that learned body was reduced
by the rejection of all the biddings, they put themselves
under the care of Lord Byron, who produced the
<span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Hereon followed “The Rejected Addresses” by the
brothers Horace and James Smith, published in 1812 by
John Miller, 25, Bow Street, Covent Garden, London,
and the wonderfully clever and amusing imitations and
parodies contained in the book made it at once popular,
and caused it to prominently attract the attention of the
literati of the day. The imitation of Lord Byron is not
perhaps so successful as some of the other poems. As
Lord Jeffrey remarked in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>. “The
author has succeeded better in copying the melody and
misanthropic sentiments of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>, than the nervous
and impetuous diction in which his noble biographer
has embodied them.” It is not to be expected that the
burlesque address, by the brothers Smith, should present
any resemblance to Lord Byron’s opening address at
Drury Lane.</p>

<p>“The effect produced by the erection of a life-size <em>silhouette</em>
of the statue of the Iron Duke and his war-steed opposite the
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Park front of the Horse Guards has quickly
resulted in a decision to melt down Mr. Wyatt’s equestrian

<div class="i1">For there stood the steed with his nostril all wide,</div>
<div class="i1">And his nose all turned up in his evident pride,</div>
<div class="i1">And his tail that seemed dressed with the stiffest of starch,</div>
<div class="i1">Stood out ’midst the trees, as it had on the Arch.</div>

<div class="i1">That long years of scoffing had failed to o’erturn,</div>
<div class="i1">And his hat was still cocked at the angle of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">And the same scrubby cape on his shoulders he wore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And those that passed by gave one shuddering look,</div>
<div class="i1">And vowed such a Duke they no longer would brook.</div>
<div class="i1">They cried, “Take him off to some near melting-pot!”</div>
<div class="i1">And hastened forthwith from the terrible spot.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the chosen Committee itself had to own</div>
<div class="i1">That nought could the horse’s appearance condone;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst as to the rider, they had to confess</div>
<div class="i1">That melting alone could his failings redress.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So it straightway decided no site could be found</div>
<div class="i1">For this effigy vile of a warrior renowned;</div>
<div class="i1">And ere very long they put forth a decree</div>
<div class="i1">That the Duke and his charger both melted should be!</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">And the Statues of London were loud in their wail,</div>
<div class="i1">And the Griffin, in agony, waggled his tail,</div>
<div class="i1">Exclaiming, “Alas! if the Duke’s melted thus,</div>

<div class="i1">I had my reasons, which might be revealed</div>

<div class="i1">Which tied my tongue to silence. Time passed on.</div>

<div class="i1">His finger on his nose’s side, and jeered;</div>
<div class="i1">Others in horrid mockery laughed outright;</div>
<div class="i1">Yea, dogs, deceived by instinct’s dubious ray,</div>
<div class="i1">Fixing their swart glare on my ragged hat,</div>
<div class="i1">Mistook me for a beggar, and they barked.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus women, men, friends, strangers, lovers, dogs,</div>
<div class="i1">One thought pervaded all&mdash;it was my hat.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A change, it was the last, came o’er this hat,</div>
<div class="i1">For lo! at length the circling months went round:</div>
<div class="i1">The period was accomplished&mdash;and one day</div>
<div class="i1">This tattered, brown old greasy coverture</div>
<div class="i1">(Time had endeared its vileness) was transferred</div>
<div class="i1">To the possession of a wandering son</div>
<div class="i1">Of Israel’s fated race&mdash;and friends once more</div>
<div class="i1">Greeted my digits with the wonted squeeze:</div>
<div class="i1">Once more I went my way, along, along,</div>
<div class="i1">And plucked no wondering gaze; the hand of scorn</div>
<div class="i1">With its annoying finger, men, and dogs,</div>
<div class="i1">Once more grew pointless, jokeless, laughless, growlless&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And at last, not least of rescued blessings, love!</div>
<div class="i1">Love smiled on me again, when I assumed</div>
<div class="i1">A brand new chapeau of the Melton build;</div>
<div class="i1">And then the laugh was mine, for, then out came</div>
<div class="i1">The secret of this strangeness&mdash;’twas <em>a bet</em>,&mdash;</div>

<p>Lord Byron was married in January, 1815, and about
the middle of January, 1816, Lady Byron left London for
her father’s house in Leicestershire, on the understanding
that Lord Byron was shortly to follow her. But her
father immediately wrote to acquaint Lord Byron that
she would never return to him. The reasons for this
conduct have never been satisfactorily explained, and
though Lord Byron, and his friends, tried their utmost to
bring about a reconciliation, all attempts to alter Lady
Byron’s decision were in vain. This domestic misfortune
supplied the enemies of Lord Byron with a pretext for the
gratification of their envious and malignant feelings
towards him. The press teemed with slanderous and
abominable insinuations in explanation of the conjugal
feud. The majority of his acquaintances declared against
him; and the proud spirit of the noble poet, stung to the

quick, impelled him to leave his country. On the 25th
of April, 1816, Lord Byron left England, never to return.</p>

<p>A short time prior to his final departure from his native
land, he published the “Siege of Corinth” and “Parisina.”
He also wrote two short poems, which were highly
popular, and which first appeared in the public papers&mdash;“Fare
Thee Well,” and “A Sketch from Private Life.”</p>

<p>In “Fare thee Well,” Byron pathetically alludes to his
daughter, Augusta Ada, the only child of his unfortunate
marriage, who was born on December 10, 1815.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Lady Byron’s Reply to Lord Byron’s</span> <br />
“<span class="sc">Fare Thee Well.</span>”</p>

<p>“As to the author of the reply, I have for years been
trying to find out, but unsuccessfully. One or two gentlemen,
whose opinions on this subject are well worthy of
attention, have said in a joking way that the author must
be Byron himself, as the lines are so very beautiful and
appropriate. I certainly do not think Lady Byron was
the author. From all that I can glean from the oldest
inhabitants in this neighbourhood she was always held in
the highest respect, a good, kind, domestic lady; but no
one seems to give her credit for much poetic taste, let alone
faculty.”</p>

<p>Whatever were the causes of the separation of Lady
Byron from her husband (and many reasons have been
assigned) will probably never be known, nor do they concern
us here, except in so far as regards the statements
made by Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1869 it pleased
this American authoress to contribute an article to a
London magazine, in which she deliberately accused Lord
Byron of having committed the foulest crimes imaginable,
and stated that although Lady Byron was aware of his
depravity from their very wedding day, she yet continued
to reside with him until after the birth of their daughter.
A violent controversy ensued, many old scandals were
revived, and whilst Mrs. Stowe’s statements were generally
disbelieved, Byron’s reputation suffered considerably.
For this result Thomas Moore was mainly to blame, he
having destroyed the memoirs entrusted to him by Lord
Byron. Had these memoirs been published, it is very
improbable that Mrs. Stowe’s article would have ever have
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
been written. Moore was imprudent enough to show these
memoirs to several people, as well as the concluding five
Cantos of Don Juan, before he destroyed them, and it is
said that Lady Burghersh made copies of them. It is
possible, therefore that Byron’s view of the circumstances
may yet be given to the world, but however that may be,
nothing can excuse the action of Mrs. Stowe, whose article
could serve no other purpose than that of blackening the
memory of a great but ill-used and unfortunate <span class="lock">man:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Waterloo at Astley’s Theatre.</span></p>

<p>“According to the latest Astley authorities, dated last
June, the Battle of Waterloo occupied six minutes exactly.
Several French soldiers walked undisguisedly into the quarters
of the English army before the fight commenced; and some,
at the extreme back of the scene, fought indiscriminately on
either side, as occasion required. But the gravest circumstance
is, that in the heat of the action the Duke of
Wellington, approaching Marshall Soult, said to him, ‘Don’t
let your fellows fire until mine have’! a course which must
have led them to destruction, had not General Widdicombe
roared, with a voice of thunder, ‘what the devil are you doing
there, you stupid asses?’ which produced the last grand
charge. The following beautiful lines are but little known,
and well deserve a place in this report. They are the production
of Lord Byron, and were written at the request of
the late Andrew Ducrow, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, describing the scene
immediately before the commencement of the battle.”</p>

<p>These lines refer to the first appearance of Mr. Henry
Irving in the Character of “Othello.” The success he met
with then, induced him to revive it some time afterward,
and proves how reliable these verses were as a criticism.
But at that time <cite>The Figaro</cite> persistently and indiscriminately
ran down all Mr. Irving’s impersonations.</p>

<p>A parody entitled <cite>Childe Snobson’s Pilgrimage</cite>,
in several parts, appeared in volume <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> of <cite>Punch</cite>
1842; and again, in 1883, another long parody of
<cite>Childe Harold</cite> ran through several numbers of the
same periodical. This was called <cite>Childe Chappie’s
Pilgrimage</cite>, and, when complete, was issued in
book form by Bradbury Agnew &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, with the
Author’s name, E. J. Milliken, on the title page,
and some illustrations by E. J. Wheeler.</p>

<p>This work is at once a parody of Childe Harold,
and a satire on the typical young “Masher” of the
period, who, having exhausted all modern forms of
dissipation, finally “comes an awful cropper” in
the slang of his tribe.</p>

<p>“Childe Chappie” bids farewell to the haunts
of his boyhood in the following verses, sung to the
accompaniment of a banjo.</p>

<div class="i1">In those old days which poets say were golden&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">They had their May, but no Mayfair as yet,</div>
<div class="i2">No fashions varying as the hues of morn.</div>
<div class="i1">Just as they pleased they dressed, and drank, and ate,</div>
<div class="i2">Sang hymns to Ceres (their John Barleycorn),</div>
<div class="i1">And danced unchaperoned, and laughed unchecked,</div>
<div class="i1">And were, no doubt, extremely incorrect.</div>

<div class="i1">Yet do I think their theory was pleasant:</div>
<div class="i2">And oft, I own, my “wayward fancy roams”</div>

<div class="i1">Nor smote a billiard-ball, nor winged a pheasant,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor “did” her hair by means of long-tailed combs,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor migrated to Brighton once a year,</div>

<div class="i1">The Greek mind must have had some vital fault,</div>
<div class="i2">That they should stick to liquors so injurious&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">(Wine, Water, tempered p’raps with Attic salt)&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">And not at once invent that mild, luxurious,</div>

<div class="i1">Oh! I have gazed into my foaming glass,</div>

<div class="i2">But vile concoctions to make dull heads ache?</div>
<div class="i1">Nay, stout itself&mdash;(though good with oysters, very)&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Is not a thing your reading man should take.</div>
<div class="i1">He that would shine, and petrify his tutor</div>

<p>In “<cite>The Poetic Mirror, or The Living Bards of
Britain</cite>,” written by James Hogg, there is a poem
entitled <cite>The Guerilla</cite>, written in the Spenserian
stanza adopted by Lord Byron in his <cite>Childe
Harold</cite>. As <cite>The Guerilla</cite> is a serious poem, not a
parody, it would be out of place here. It consists
of 47 stanzas, and is the first poem in <cite>The Poetic
Mirror</cite>, of which volume a full account will be
found on page 96.</p>

<p>A parody, entitled <cite>The Last Canto of Childe
Harold</cite>, by Lamartine, was published in London
in 1827, but is now difficult to find.</p>

<p>“Several hundred lively turtles were thrown overboard a
little while ago from a ship bound for Liverpool. The
Mayor of that town, who is remarkable for hospitality, has
been, ever since the sad event, in a state of fearful despondency.
The following touching lament has been heard to
issue from his windows at fitful and feverish intervals&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i1">Know ye the loss of the beautiful turtles,</div>

<div class="i2">Let me mourn for the loss of a feast so sublime.</div>
<div class="i1">Did they do it from fear?&mdash;did they do it in fun?</div>
<div class="i1">Sure no one could smile at the mischief they’ve done.</div>
<div class="i1">Had shipwreck been threaten’d, and had it been known,</div>
<div class="i1">That everything must have been overboard thrown.</div>
<div class="i1">Though the whole of the freight in the ocean were cast,</div>
<div class="i1">The turtles should always be kept till the last.</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, had I been there in that terrible hour,</div>
<div class="i1">As Mayor I’d at once have exerted my power,</div>
<div class="i1">And made the most active endeavours to save</div>
<div class="i1">The turtle alive, from a watery grave,</div>
<div class="i1">I envy thee, <span class="sc">Neptune</span>&mdash;for thou art possess’d</div>
<div class="i1">Of a treasure by which I had hoped to be blessed;</div>
<div class="i1">I’m almost disposed to make one of thy group,</div>

<div class="i1">And is there no charm in thine own native earth?</div>

<div class="i1">Are her sons less renowned, or her warriors less brave,</div>

<p>A “Native of the Great American Desert” writes from
Rosario on Colorado and its bug:&mdash;“We knew that
potato bug before he was introduced into polite society
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
and world-wide fame; he was then called the ‘camote
spoiler,’ a name derived from a sweet tuber that grows
wild all over Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. Generations
would have died ignorant of the very name of our
newest State had it not been for the potato bug;
newspapers wrote, orators eulogized, and poets sang
about the advantages of Colorado, but all combined
they could not command the attention of anybody east
of the Mississippi river until that bug went booming
across the Atlantic States and Ocean, and actually entered
the House of Lords and the Privy Councils of various
European monarchs. Since that day Colorado has become
universally known, and one of its mountain poets
something in ideas like Goethe, but in style after Byron,
has chanted&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Civic Mazeppa.</span></p>

<p>“The disappearance of <span class="sc">Gibbs</span> from the civic procession
created some little astonishment, and many were the inquiries
as to what had become of him. The following Poem gives a
bold, but very probable, notion of how the Alderman was
really occupied on the day of the opening of the Royal Exchange.
It is supposed that some of his fellow parishioners,
meeting with him in a back street, caught hold of him, and
tied him on to a horse, which got dreadfully into a-rear, and
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
was then suffered to run on without the smallest check&mdash;thus
typifying the state of the accounts of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, Walbrook.
The Poem begins at the period when the Alderman is about
to undergo his equestrian martyrdom.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“Bring forth the horse!” the horse was brought;</div>
<div class="i2">In truth he was a noble steed&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">A creature of the hackney sort,</div>
<div class="i2">Dash’d slightly with the dray-horse breed,</div>
<div class="i1">His sire had drawn a fly,</div>
<div class="i2">Into which six would often cram;</div>
<div class="i1">His mother was of lineage high,</div>
<div class="i2">Himself was worth&mdash;well worth his dam.</div>
<div class="i1">He plunged, he kick’d, he reared, he snorted,</div>
<div class="i1">With ears erect and eye distorted;</div>
<div class="i1">He switched his tail, he show’d his hoof&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">E’en <span class="sc">Widdicomb</span> had kept aloof</div>
<div class="i1">At sight of such a noble steed,</div>
<div class="i1">He was a precious beast indeed.</div>
<div class="i1">They seized me fiercely by the daddle;</div>
<div class="i1">They thrust me down into the saddle;</div>
<div class="i1">They tied me strongly by the bridle:</div>
<div class="i2">The horrid brute began to shy,</div>
<div class="i1">To kick, to amble, and to sidle,</div>
<div class="i2">And then away they let him fly;</div>
<div class="i1">Away, away! my breath is gone;</div>
<div class="i1">Still gallop, gallop, gallop on,</div>
<div class="i1">Down, down the street, and up the Strand,</div>
<div class="i1">Over the woman’s apple-stand.</div>
<div class="i1">We pass the cabs, and here we are,</div>
<div class="i1">Plunged at one bound through Temple Bar.</div>
<div class="i1">The courser’s fleetness seems to mock</div>
<div class="i1">The slowness of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan’s Clock.</div>
<div class="i1">Away, away, we madly whisk</div>
<div class="i1">Along! past Waithman’s Obelisk!</div>
<div class="i1">On, on we go, we gallop still</div>
<div class="i1">Up Ludgate’s gently rising hill.</div>
<div class="i1">A moment now our way seems barr’d,</div>
<div class="i2">Oh! shall we stop at last?</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis the barrier at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s Church Yard&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">No, no, he gallops past.</div>
<div class="i1">I pull’d the bridle, but in vain,</div>
<div class="i2">The horse refused my will to heed;</div>
<div class="i1">Each motion of the useless rein</div>
<div class="i2">But madden’d him to wilder speed.</div>
<div class="i1">I tried my voice; but nonsense, pooh!</div>
<div class="i1">Onwards the brute contemptuous flew:</div>
<div class="i1">At times I thought he must have stopp’d,</div>
<div class="i1">When ’gainst an omnibus he whopp’d;</div>
<div class="i1">But vain my hopes! the sudden blow</div>
<div class="i1">Served but to make him faster go.</div>
<div class="i1">Away, away, we turn and wind,</div>
<div class="i1">Leaving the city far behind.</div>
<div class="i1">He tears away, hock touching hock,</div>
<div class="i1">Swift up the hill of Haverstock:</div>
<div class="i1">Until, with just exhausted breath,</div>
<div class="i1">At last he reaches Hampstead Heath.</div>
<div class="i1">The brute has only strength to bound</div>
<div class="i1">Into the well remembered Pound;</div>
<div class="i1">Where in the morning we were found</div>
<div class="i1">By a policeman going his round.</div>

<p><cite>Warreniana</cite>, by Mr. William F. Deacon (London,
1824), contained an excellent parody on <cite>Childe
Harold</cite>, unfortunately it is too long to give in full,
but some stanzas may be quoted.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Childe’s Pilgrimage.</span></div>
<div class="poemdivider">1.</div>
<div class="i2">Whileome in Limehouse docks there dwelt a youth,</div>
<div class="i2">Childe Higgins hight, the childe of curst ennui,</div>
<div class="i2">Despair, shame, sin, with aye assailing tooth,</div>
<div class="i2">Had worn his beauty to the bone.&mdash;Ah me!</div>
<div class="i2">A lone unloving libertine was he;</div>
<div class="i2">For reft of health and hope’s delusive wiles,</div>
<div class="i2">And tossed in youth on passion’s stormy sea,</div>
<div class="i2">He stood a wreck ’mid its deserted isles,</div>
<div class="i1">Where vainly pleasure wooes and syren woman smiles.</div>
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
<div class="poemdivider">2.</div>
<div class="i2">He was a merchant, ’till ennui’d with toil</div>
<div class="i2">Of counting house turned but to small account,</div>
<div class="i2">Sated of home, and Limehouse leaden soil,</div>
<div class="i2">Nee more to his dried heart a freshening fount</div>
<div class="i2">Of kindly feelings; he aspired to mount</div>
<div class="i2">To intellectual fame, for when the brain</div>
<div class="i2">Is dulled by thoughts, aye fearful to surmount,</div>
<div class="i2">When youth, hope, love, essay their charms in vain,</div>
<div class="i1">The rake-hell turns a blue as doth his sky again.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">3.</div>
<div class="i2">Thus turned the Childe, when in the Morning Post,</div>
<div class="i2">The Herald, Chronicle, and eke the Times,</div>
<div class="i2">He read with tasteful glee a daily host</div>
<div class="i2">Of the Strand bard’s self eulogistic rhymes;</div>
<div class="i2">He read, and fired with zeal, resolv’d betimes</div>
<div class="i2">A pilgrim to that minstrel’s shrine to move,</div>
<div class="i2">As Allah’s votaries in Arabian climes</div>
<div class="i2">To far Medina’s hallowed altar rove,</div>
<div class="i1">There low to bend before the idol of their love.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">4.</div>
<div class="i2">He left his home, his wife without a sigh,</div>
<div class="i2">And trod with pilgrim-pace the Limehouse Road;</div>
<div class="i2">The morn beamed laughing in the dark blue sky,</div>
<div class="i2">And warm the sun on post and pavement glowed:</div>
<div class="i2">Each varied mile new charms and churches showed,</div>
<div class="i2">But sceptic Higgins jeered the sacred band;</div>
<div class="i2">For his full tide of thought with scorn o’erflowed,</div>
<div class="i2">Or deep immersed in objects grave and grand,</div>
<div class="i1">Dwelt on the Warren’s fame at number Thirty, Strand.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="poemdivider">11.</div>
<div class="i2">Th’ Exchange is past, the Mansion House appears,</div>
<div class="i2">Surpris’d the Childe surveys its portly site,</div>
<div class="i2">Dim dreams assail him of convivial years,</div>
<div class="i2">And keener waxes his blunt appetite,</div>
<div class="i2">Luxurious visions whelm his fancy quite,</div>
<div class="i2">Of calipash and ekecalipee,</div>
<div class="i2">While sylphs of twenty stone steal o’er his sight,</div>
<div class="i2">Smiting their thighs with blythe Apician glee,</div>
<div class="i1">And licking each his lips right beautiful to see.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">12.</div>
<div class="i2">’Twas here they tucked, these unctuous city sprites,</div>
<div class="i2">’Twas here like geese they fattened and they died.</div>
<div class="i2">Here turtle reared for them her keen delights,</div>
<div class="i2">And forests yielded their cornuted pride.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">But all was vain, ’mid daintiest feasts they sighed;</div>
<div class="i2">Gout trod in anger on each hapless toe;</div>
<div class="i2">Stern apoplexy pummelled each fat side,</div>
<div class="i2">And dropsy seconded his deadly blow,</div>
<div class="i1">’Till floored by fate they sunk to endless sleep below.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="poemdivider">15.</div>
<div class="i2">Something too much of this; but now ’tis past,</div>
<div class="i2">And Fleet Street spreads her busy vale below:</div>
<div class="i2">Lo! proud ambitious gutters hurry past,</div>
<div class="i2">To rival Thames in full continuous flow;</div>
<div class="i2">The inner temple claims attention now,</div>
<div class="i2">That Golgotha of thick and thread-bare skulls,</div>
<div class="i2">Where modest merit pines in chambers low,</div>
<div class="i2">And impudence his oar in triumph pulls</div>
<div class="i1">Along the stream of wealth, and snares its rich sea-gulls.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="poemdivider">19.</div>
<div class="i2">Thus mused the Childe as thoughtful he drew near</div>
<div class="i2">The sacred shrine of number Thirty, Strand,</div>
<div class="i2">And saw bright glittering in the hemisphere</div>
<div class="i2">Like stars on moony nights&mdash;a sacred band</div>
<div class="i2">Of words that formed the bard’s cognomen grand</div>
<div class="i2">Each letter shone beneath the eye of day,</div>
<div class="i2">And the proud sign-boot, by spring breezes fanned,</div>
<div class="i2">Shot its deep brass reflections o’er the way,</div>
<div class="i1">As shoots the tropic morn o’er meads of Paraquay.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="poemdivider">21.</div>
<div class="i2">But I forgot&mdash;my pilgrim’s shrine is won</div>
<div class="i2">And he himself&mdash;the lone unloving Childe</div>
<div class="i2">His Limehouse birth, his name, his sandal-shoon,</div>
<div class="i2">And scallop shell are dreams by fancy piled:</div>
<div class="i2">His dull despairing thoughts alone&mdash;once mild</div>
<div class="i2">As love&mdash;now dark as fable’s darkest hell,</div>
<div class="i2">Are stern realities; but o’er the wild</div>
<div class="i2">Drear desert of their blight the soothing spell</div>
<div class="i1">Of Warren’s verse flits rare as sun-beams o’er Pall Mall.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">22.</div>
<div class="i2">Farewell&mdash;a word that must be and hath been</div>
<div class="i2">Ye dolphin dames who turn from blue to grey</div>
<div class="i2">Ye dandy drones who charm each festive scene</div>
<div class="i2">With brainless buzz, and frolic in your May,</div>
<div class="i2">Ye ball-room bards who live your little day,</div>
<div class="i2">And ye who flushed in purse parade the town,</div>
<div class="i2">Booted or shod&mdash;to you my muse would say,</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Miscellaneous Parodies of Lord Byron’s Works.</span></p>

<p>A very large number of Parodies of Byron’s poems have
been produced in the form of small pamphlets, either on
political or social events, or of purely local interest. It
will be sufficient to enumerate the principal of these, the
curious in such matters can easily refer to them in the
Library of the British Museum.</p>

<p class="hanging"><cite>The Age of Soapsuds.</cite> A Satire, by Lord Vyron. London.
W. Edwards, 1839; <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 15.</p>

<p>In his preface the author remarks: “We live in an
age of bubbles, and if the ‘Soapsud’ of the following
lines seem blown about on the gale of fancy&mdash;all I can say
is, I write to please myself, and not the critics.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><cite>Despair</cite>: A Vision. <cite>Derry Down and John Bull</cite>: A
Simile. Being two Political Parodies on “Darkness,”
and a scene from “The Giaour,” by Lord Byron.
London. T. Hughes 1820.&mdash;Political, and of no
interest at present.</p>

<p><cite>Arlis’s Pocket Magazine for</cite> 1825, contained a parody of
“The Maid of Athens,” entitled <cite>Sarah, I Love Thee</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Railway Adventures and Anecdotes</cite>, edited by Richard
Pike, 1884, contains a parody on the lines commencing&mdash;“There
was a sound of Revelry by night.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><cite>The Mongrelites; or, The Radicals so-called.</cite> A Satiric
Poem. By &mdash;&mdash;. Published in New York, by Van
Evrie, Horton and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, in 1866 (59 <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>)</p>

<p>This is said by the author to be an imitation of Byron’s
“English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,” but as it relates
to the party politics of the United States it does not come
within the scope of this collection.</p>

<p>Two prize poems, in imitation of <cite>English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers</cite> were printed in <cite>The World</cite>, April 14, 1880. The
subject chosen was <cite>Electioneering Speeches</cite>, the poems were
therefore of merely passing interest.</p>

<p>In 1834 a small sixpenny pamphlet was published by
Chalmers and Son, of Edinburgh, entitled <cite>Lays of Straiton
House</cite>. It contained several poems, written in imitation
of Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, and of a few popular
songs. These were descriptive of the Caledonian Bazaar
and its contents were of local interest only, and are now
quite out of date.</p>

<p class="hanging"><cite>Abel</cite>: written, but with great humility, in reply to Lord
Byron’s <cite>Cain</cite>. By Owen Howell. London: John
Mardon, 1843; <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 22.</p>

<p>“The object of Lord Byron in his drama ‘Cain,’ was
to embody all the emotions of Despair as they act upon
the human mind; in the present poem (if it deserves the
name) the author has endeavoured to personify Hope, and
to bring together as many pleasing expectations as possible.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><cite>Cain</cite>: A Poem, intended to be published in Parts, containing
an Antidote to the Impiety and Blasphemy of
Lord Byron’s Cain. By Henry Wilkinson, Stone-gate,
York. London: Baldwin, Cradock and Joy. 1824.
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 97.</p>

<p>(A short poem, with voluminous notes, violently abusive
of Lord Byron’s poem, and his theological views.)</p>

<p class="hanging">Several of Lord Byron’s poems have been produced upon
the stage, the most notable examples being <cite>Manfred</cite>,
brought out at Drury Lane Theatre some years since,
with grand scenic effects; and <cite>Mazeppa</cite>, at Astley’s
Theatre, with Ada Isaacs Menken in the title <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i>.
<cite>Mazeppa</cite> has, however, long been quite a stock piece
with Circus proprietors, and as far back as December 27,
1858, a burlesque of it (written by the late Henry James
Byron) was produced at the Olympic Theatre, with
F. Robson, H. Wigan, Miss Wyndham, and Mrs. Emden
in the caste, which had a long and successful run.</p>

<p class="hanging">The late Mr. Gilbert Abbot a’Beckett wrote a burlesque,
entitled <cite>Man-Fred</cite> in 1828; and Mr. H. Such Granville
wrote “<cite>Sardanapolus</cite>, or The Light of other Days, an
original Ninevitish Burlesque,” which was first performed
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Hall, on December 23, 1868,
when the author performed the part of <i>Zarina</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging">“<cite>The Bride of Abydos</cite>; or, The Prince, the Pirate, and the
Pearl” was the title of another Burlesque, written by
the late Henry James Byron,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span> and produced at the
Strand Theatre, with a strong caste, including Mr. H. J.
Turner, Miss M. Oliver, and Miss Swanborough.</p>

<p>As a rule these burlesques merely give a ludicrous turn
to the plot of the original poems, and contain little which
could be quoted as interesting parodies.</p>

<p class="p2">Amongst the numerous Parodies, Imitations and

<p class="blockquote">“I am not the author, and never heard of the work in

formal annunciation of ‘The Vampire,’ with the addition of
an account of my ‘residence in the Island of Mitylene,’ an
island which I have occasionally sailed by in the course of
travelling some years ago through the Levant&mdash;and where I
should have no objection to reside&mdash;but where I have never
yet resided.… Neither of these performances are mine,
and I presume that it is neither unjust nor ungracious to
request that you will favour me by contradicting the advertisement
to which I allude. If the book is clever it would be
hard to deprive the real writer&mdash;whoever he may be&mdash;of his
honours; and if stupid&mdash;I desire the responsibility of nobody’s
dulness but my own.… The imputation is of no great
importance, and as long as it was confined to surmises and
reports I should have received it as I have received many
others&mdash;in silence. But the formality of a public advertisement
of a book I never wrote&mdash;and a residence where I
never resided&mdash;is a little too much, particularly as I have no
notion of the contents of one, nor the incidents of the other.
I have, besides, a personal dislike to ‘Vampires,’ and the
little acquaintance I have with them would by no means
induce me to divulge their secrets.”</p>

<p>The following parody of <cite>The Last Rose of Summer</cite>
is rather slangy, and would not have been inserted,
but for the fact that it originally appeared in
part 9 of <cite>The Snob</cite> (June 4, 1829), a small paper
published in Cambridge, to which it is known that
Thackeray contributed. It is, therefore, not improbable
that he was the author of this parody.</p>

<div class="i1">O’er Erin’s Isle, in rule awhile,</div>
<div class="i2">What British knaves have blundered!</div>
<div class="i1">Their state misused, and power abused&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">And prisoned, packed, and plundered.</div>
<div class="i1">But soon or late, they met the fate,</div>
<div class="i2">That evil in despair knows;</div>
<div class="i1">We tore in rags, their tinsel tags,</div>
<div class="i2">And set them up as scarecrows.</div>
<div class="i4">Oh, the scarecrows,</div>
<div class="i4">No wind that foul or fair blows,</div>

<div class="i2">With certain ammunition,</div>
<div class="i1">His burly nod sent folks to quod,</div>
<div class="i2">Of high and low condition;</div>
<div class="i1">Yet came the day when far away,</div>
<div class="i2">We saw the Yorkshire bear go</div>
<div class="i1">And take his place in dire disgrace</div>
<div class="i2">A grim and gruffy scarecrow!</div>
<div class="i4">Oh, the scarecrow</div>
<div class="i4">No village bantam dare crow,</div>

<div class="i1">But if he did, the seeds he hid</div>
<div class="i2">The morrow saw in air grow,</div>
<div class="i1">While prospects marred he mounted guard,</div>
<div class="i2">A most disgusted scarecrow.</div>
<div class="i4">Oh, the scarecrow</div>
<div class="i4">Can annals anywhere show</div>
<div class="i6">A weaker fool</div>
<div class="i6">Sent, <em>men</em> to rule</div>

<div class="i1">Trevelyan tried, sneered, whined and lied,</div>

<div class="i1">Alas, poor Pinch! we inch by inch,</div>
<div class="i2">Brought you to wreck and care low,</div>
<div class="i1">It seems to me, of all the three,</div>
<div class="i2">You made the meanest scarecrow.</div>

<div class="i6">Must ever wait</div>

<div class="i2">A failed and beaten scarecrow.</div>
<div class="i4">Oh, the scarecrow</div>

<div class="i6">To hear the joints</div>
<div class="i6">Of Johnny Poyntz</div>
<div class="i1">Groan dry like any scarecrow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So friends shall fall the strangers all,</div>
<div class="i2">Who seek to crush our nation;</div>
<div class="i1">Nor rope nor “soap” can hope to cope</div>
<div class="i2">With grim determination;</div>
<div class="i1">And while our tree of liberty,</div>
<div class="i2">More branching green and fair grows,</div>
<div class="i1">Our museum shall filled become</div>
<div class="i2">With sick and sorry scarecrows.</div>

<p>(The Duke of Cumberland was the least popular of all the
sons of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> His manners were rude, overbearing,
and sometimes even brutal, and he was profligate, selfish,
and quarrelsome. On the accession of Queen Victoria, the
throne of Hanover passed to him in virtue of the Salic law,
and the greatest public satisfaction was felt on his departure
for his new kingdom, where his breaches of faith, and tyrannical
conduct, soon led to commotions which had to be
quelled by severe military measures. He died in 1851).</p>

<p>“Every one is acquainted with Moore’s beautiful poem of
Paradise and the Peri, in which the fallen spirit is represented
as seeking on earth for a boon to regain the heaven
she has lost. The story assimilates closely to a late affair, in
which a certain military Tory (the Duke of Wellington),
having lost the heaven of place (to him far more desirable
than any <em>place in heaven</em>) devised all kinds of tricks to regain
his former position.</p>

<p>This humorous poem was written by Mr. Walter Parke
the dramatist, and author of many skilful and amusing
parodies. <cite>Lays of the Saintly</cite>, by the same gentleman, (Vizetelly
and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, London.) contains the lives of the principal
Saints, told in rhymes imitating Swinburne, Tennyson,
Longfellow, and other poets. One of the best of these
legends is undoubtedly that devoted to the adventures
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, the patron Saint of Ireland. Most appropriately
this is written after Moore’s style, and parodies of
a number of his melodies are ingeniously woven into the
narrative. Amongst these are “<cite>Eveleen’s Bower</cite>,” “<cite>Love’s
Young Dream</cite>,” “<cite>She is far from the Land</cite>,” “<cite>Oft in the
Stilly night</cite>,” “<cite>The Harp that Once</cite>,” “<cite>The Woodpecker</cite>,”
“<cite>Let Erin remember</cite>,” and “<cite>The Meeting of the Waters</cite>.”
Perhaps the last is the best imitation of <span class="lock">style:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">For the Minister’s lips to their destiny true,</div>

<div class="i2">But my heart and my face got as tough as cow’s leather.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At length when arrived in my office I sat,</div>
<div class="i2">And I heard of its tricks, with a slight twinge of pain,</div>

<div class="i1">Professions, manœuvres, smiles, bowing, I used,</div>

<div class="i2">Whilst I swore that their sighs were but signs of consenting.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">How the Catholic claims I scorned and denied,</div>
<div class="i2">Till I found my reward in a better place here;</div>
<div class="i1">When the Duke, rest his soul, his old principles shied,</div>
<div class="i2">Saying “Rat with me, Peel, or your places forbear.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In vain did I whisper, there’s no danger nigh,</div>
<div class="i2">Bags, Bexley, and Sellis’s Duke did implore,</div>

<div class="i2">I acknowledged them both, and I asked for no more.</div>

<p><cite>The Melbourne Punch</cite> for July 1, 1880, contained a long,
and very dreary parody, entitled <cite>Paradise and the Berri</cite>. It
dealt with local politics, and was chiefly devoted to insulting
a politician named Berry, it had no literary merit whatever.
<cite>The Melbourne Punch</cite> is published at double the price of its
London namesake, of which it is but a very poor imitation.</p>

<p><cite>Paradise and the Peeler</cite> is the title of another long parody
contained in <cite>Lyrics and Lays</cite>, by Pips. Published in 1867,
by Wyman, Bros., Calcutta. This relates how the Eden
gardens in Calcutta were closed to the general public, by
order of the Commissioner of the Police, until a general
outcry forced him to withdraw the obnoxious edict.</p>

<p>During Oxford Commemoration in 1866, the S. S.
Amateurs performed in the Masonic Hall an “Oriental Extravaganza,”
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
entitled <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>. This was written by Mr.
Vincent Amcotts, of Balliol College, (founded upon Moore’s
poem), and the numerous songs it contained were set to
music selected from Offenbach’s “<cite>Barbe Bleu</cite>.” This
amusing travestie was published by T. Shrimpton and Son,
Broad Street, Oxford.</p>

<p>Another Extravaganza, with the same title, was produced at
the unfortunate Novelty Theatre, London, in May, 1884.
The libretto was written by Mr. Horace Lennard, the
musical arrangements were by Mr. P. Bucalossi, and the caste
included Miss Kate Vaughan, as <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>, Mr. Harry
Nicholls, and Mr. Fred Story; the piece, however, had but
a brief career.</p>

<p>Several other dramatic arrangements of <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite> have
been produced, there was a burletta by Horn; a cantata by
Messrs. W. G. Wills and Frederick Clay; and forty years

<p>Sixty or seventy years ago when Moore’s poems
were in the height of their popularity they were
made the subject of a vast number of parodies.
Of these the majority would now be of no interest
whatever, relating as they do to persons and events
long since forgotten. Some of the best of these
old parodies have already been given, a few others
may be enumerated to which reference could
easily be made by any reader desirous of seeing
them.</p>

<p class="small"><cite>The Spirit of the Public Journals</cite> for 1823 contained a great
many travesties of Moore’s Irish melodies, nearly all of which
were political. The first lines of these are as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Go where Plutus waits thee.</li>
<li>Remember the Deeds of Sir Billy the Fat.</li>
<li>Rich and rare were the gems she wore</li>
<li>If in death I should lie supine.</li>
<li>When first I met thee, fat and fair.</li>
<li>’Tis the last squeak of <em>Derry</em>, left nearly alone.</li>
<li>We can roam through the Town, and of <em>Flats</em> make a feast.</li>
<li>Peggy hath a squinting eye. (See <a href="#Page_245">page 245</a>.)</li>
<li>Come send round the wine. (See <a href="#Page_243">page 243</a>.)</li>
<li>Though numerous our debts are.</li>
<li>Oh! had I some nice little lass of my own.</li>
<li>Come rest in this bosom, my sweet pretty dear!</li>
<li>Rich and furred was the robe he wore. (See <a href="#Page_238">page 238</a>.)</li>
<li>Fly not yet.</li>
<li>Blesington hath a beaming eye.</li>
<li>Go where Bennett waits thee.</li>
<li>The Old Whig Club is meeting, Duke.</li>
</ul>

<p>The same Volume also contains a Burlesque review, or,
as it is termed, a criticism extraordinary, upon a supposed poem,
entitled <cite>Loves of the Mortals</cite>, by Timothy Tickle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> This
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i> was published a few days after <cite>The Loves of the

<p><cite>Figaro in London</cite>, a sarcastic paper published in London
in 1831-32-33, contained many parodies of Moore’s Melodies,
the best of these have already been given.</p>

<p><cite>Punch</cite> for 1847 contained <cite>The Loves of the New Police</cite>, in
several parts. In December 13, 1856, it had a set of verses
addressed to a certain <em>Mr. Morris Moore</em>, parodying several
of Moore’s Songs.</p>

<p><cite>Funny Folks</cite>, May 10, 1884, on the Dynamite scare:
“Believe me that all these explosive alarms.”</p>

<p><cite>The Humourous Works</cite> of the late Theodore Hook
(London, 1873), in addition to the parody quoted on page 238,
contain another on <cite>The young May-Moo</cite>n but it is quite out
of date. A review of “<cite>Mr. Minus the Poet</cite>” is also
included in the above collection; it is a skit upon Moore’s
versification and philosophy, and contains a short imitation
of his poetry, entitled <cite>Fanny’s Bower</cite>, somewhat resembling
<cite>The Living Lustres</cite> in the Rejected Addresses.</p>

<p>“<cite>Jack Randall’s Diary</cite>, or proceedings at the House of
Call for Genius,” written by Mr. Breakwindow. London,
Simpkin, 1820.</p>

<p class="small">This is a small book which cannot be found in the Library

<p>The great Christopher North (Professor

Moore, and in <cite>Noctes Ambrosianæ</cite> (Blackwood’s
Magazine July 1823) he thus expressed himself;&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Moore will not live long as a song writer, he has not
the stamina in him at all. His verses are elegant, pretty,
glittering, anything you please in that line; but they have
defects which will not allow them to get down to posterity.
His strong party views, his affectation of learning, his
parade of his knowledge of botany, zoology, and the other
’ologies, these are serious defects, and then the mixed
metaphors, and often down-right nonsense to be found in
his songs, all detract from his chances of immortality.”</p>

<p>Another imitation of Moore’s style is given
in <cite>The Book of Ballads</cite>, edited by <cite>Bon Gaultier</cite>,
and published by William Blackwood &amp; Sons.
These Ballads were written by Professor W. E.
Aytoun, and Theodore Martin. A few of them
may be considered amusing as parodies, but
the greater number are really clever imitations
of style, with a little burlesque introduced here
and there. Thus, the following would pass
very well for one of Moore’s lighter songs:</p>

<div class="i1">And my soul as it shrinks from each stroke of the blast,</div>

<div class="i1">No, its ashes are dead&mdash;and, alas! Love or Song</div>
<div class="i2">No charm to Life’s lengthening shadows can lend,</div>

<p>Whilst referring to Thomas Moore’s
plagiarisms mention must be made of an article
on the subject contained in Fraser’s Magazine,
<span class="pageno">277</span>
June 1841. It is too long to quote in full, but
some of its principal statements may be given:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Moore’s plagiarisms are intolerable. There is not a
single original thought, conception, metaphor, or image, in
the whole range of his works,&mdash;from the <cite>Posthumous Poems
of Tom Little</cite> to his last dying speech&mdash;The <cite>Travels of an
Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion</cite>. Even the title of
this nonsense is stolen from Erasmus’s <cite>Peregrinatio Religionis
ergo</cite>. The man is an indefatigable thief. He has
laid under contribution every imaginable book, from the
biography of his namesake, Tom Thumb, to the portly folios
of the fathers of the church. Perfectly unscrupulous in his
marauding expeditions, and impartial in his attacks, he is
found at one moment rifling a saint, and in the next pillaging
a sinner. You have asked me for some specimens of his
plagiarisms. You shall have them. Time will permit me to
expose only a very few, so I shall plunge at once <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in medias</i>

<p>“<span class="sc">Mazeppa Travestied</span>: a Poem,” is the title of a
small anonymous pamphlet published by C. Chapple, Pall
Mall, London, in 1820. Price, Half-a-crown. It has an
introductory address to “<cite>The Goddess of Milling, and her
worshippers, The Fancy</cite>.”</p>

<p>The preface contains the following sensible passage “With
regard to Travesty, or Parody in general, it may be observed
that the use of it by no means necessarily implies a design of
holding up the original to ridicule and contempt.” The
parody itself, however, is so full of slang, and deals with
such unsavoury topics, that no extracts from it can be given.
Suffice it to say that it describes the adventures and amours
of prize-fighters and their friends, in language worthy of the
theme, although it must be admitted, the parody closely
imitates the original poem in its construction. Following
the <cite>Mazeppa Travestie</cite> comes a short parody descriptive of
the defeat of Belasco, the Jewish prize-fighter.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Defeat of Crack-a-Rib.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Belasco came down like a bruiser so bold,</div>
<div class="i1">And his <em>bellows</em> was good, and his nobbers all told:</div>
<div class="i1">And the shout of his backers was like the hurrah</div>
<div class="i1">Of the <em>Black Diamond’s</em> friends, when he <em>queer’d Quashee’s</em> jaw.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Like sheep in the pens, in that business so green,</div>
<div class="i1">All sporting their <em>flimsies</em>, the kiddies were seen;</div>
<div class="i1">Like those sheep, when the shearer has thought them full grown,</div>
<div class="i1">And fleeced them, those kiddies stood chilly and lone.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For the genius of <em>Milling</em> came down on the blast,</div>
<div class="i1">And <em>bung’d</em> up the eyes of the Jew pretty fast;</div>
<div class="i1">And the <em>glims</em> of the <em>green</em> ones with gloom ’gan to fill,</div>
<div class="i1">When they saw how the gilding was gone from their pill.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And there lay the <em>cove</em> with his mouth open wide</div>
<div class="i1">But through it there came not the sounds that defied;</div>
<div class="i1">And those who have <em>made</em> him are wild on the turf,</div>
<div class="i1">That the <em>swell</em> they had raised should prove nothing but surf.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the pugilist’s <em>fancy</em> is loud in her wail,</div>
<div class="i1">For fear that her man should be clapt into jail;</div>
<div class="i1">And the <em>queer’d ones</em> of Israel no <em>blunt</em> can afford,</div>
<div class="i1">To <em>flash</em> in the ring, since their <em>swell</em> has been <em>floor’d</em>.</div>

 Old Bedlam, at that time, stood “close by London Wall.” It was
built after the model of the Tuileries, which is said to have given the
French king great offence. In front of it Moorfields extended, with
broad gravel walks crossing each other at right angles. These the

 A Scotchman, who was on his dying bed was asked by the
clergyman of his parish “And where do you think you are going to
now?” replied “Hech, meenister, ye ken this is neether the time
nor place to be asking conundrums.” So, too, it may be said, this is
neither the time, nor the place to discuss questions of political
economy. Yet&mdash;in answer to the writer of these bigoted lines&mdash;it may
be pointed out that the great, the chief reason for Scotchmen leaving
their own country, is to be found in the iniquitous land laws,
which doom so many of the finest parts of Scotland to be depopulated
for the formation of dear runs, and game preserves.</p>

<p class="footnote">And a Scotchman may point with pardonable pride to the fact, that
wherever Scotchmen go they are welcomed as honest, thrifty, and
law abiding citizens. Whilst by their industry, their intelligence, and
integrity, they win the success which is denied them in their own
country, through the survival of an obsolete feudal system, not at all
in keeping with the spirit of the age.</p>

 O.P. This personage, who is alleged to have growled
like a bull-dog, requires rather a lengthened note for the
edification of the rising generation. The “horns, rattles,
drums,” with which he is accompanied, are no inventions of
the poet. The new Covent Garden Theatre opened on the
18th September, 1809, when a cry of “Old Prices” (afterwards
diminished to O.P.) burst out from every part of the
house. This continued and increased in violence till the
23rd, when rattles, drums, whistles, and cat-calls, having
completely drowned the voices of the actors, Mr. Kemble,
the stage manager, came forward and said that a committee
of gentlemen had undertaken to examine the finances of the
concern, and that until they were prepared with their report
the theatre would continue closed. “Name them!” was
shouted from all sides. The names were declared, viz., Sir
Charles Price, the Solicitor-General, the Recorder of London,
the Governor of the Bank, and Mr. Angerstein. “All
shareholders!” bawled a wag from the gallery. In a few
days the theatre re-opened: the public paid no attention to
the report of the referees, and the tumult was renewed for
several weeks, with even increased violence. The proprietors
now sent in hired bruisers, to <em>mill</em> the refractory into subjection.
This irritated most of their former friends, and,
amongst the rest, the annotator, who accordingly wrote the
song of “Heigh-ho, says Kemble,” which was caught up by
the ballad-singers, and sung under Mr. Kemble’s house
windows in Great Russell Street. A dinner was given at
the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand, to celebrate
the victory obtained by W. Clifford in his action against
Brandon, the box-keeper, for assaulting him for wearing the
letters O.P. in his hat. At this dinner, Mr. Kemble attended,
and matters were compromised by allowing the advanced
price (seven shillings) to the boxes. The writer remembers
a former riot of a similar sort at the same theatre (in the
year 1792), when the price to the boxes was raised from five
shillings to six. That tumult, however, only lasted three
nights.</p>

 “From the knobb’d bludgeon to the taper switch.”
This image is not the creation of the poets: it sprang from
reality. The authors happened to be at the Royal Circus
when “God save the King” was called for, accompanied by
a cry of “stand up!” and “hats off!” An inebriated
naval lieutenant, perceiving a gentleman in an adjoining box
slow to obey the call, struck his hat off with his stick, exclaiming,
“Take off your hat, sir!” The other thus assaulted
proved to be, unluckily for the lieutenant, Lord Camelford,
the celebrated bruiser and duellist. A set-to in the lobby
was the consequence, where his lordship quickly proved
victorious. “The devil is not so black as he is painted,”
said one of the authors to the other; “let us call upon Lord
Camelford, and tell him that we were witnesses of his being
first assaulted.” The visit was paid on the ensuing morning
at Lord Camelford’s lodgings, in Bond Street. Over the
fire-place in the drawing-room were ornaments strongly expressive
of the pugnacity of the peer. A long thick bludgeon
lay horizontally supported by two brass hooks. Above this
was placed parallel one of lesser dimensions, until a pyramid
of weapons gradually arose, tapering to a horsewhip.</p>

<p class="footnote center">“Thus all below was strength, and all above was grace.”</p>

<p class="footnote">Lord Camelford received his visitants with great civility,
and thanked them warmly for the call; adding, that their
evidence would be material, it being his intention to indict
the lieutenant for an assault. “All I can say in return is
this,” exclaimed the peer with great cordiality, “if ever I
see you engaged in a row, upon my soul I’ll stand by you.”
The authors expressed themselves thankful for so potent an
ally, and departed. In about a fortnight afterwards (March
7, 1804), Lord Camelford was shot in a duel with Mr. Best.</p>

had to find money by the sale of commissions in the Army&mdash;it is said,
indeed, that she had also applications for bishoprics and deaneries.
The Duke of York had control of the Army, and as the regulation price
of a majority was £2,600 and of a captaincy £1,500 while Mrs. Clarke
only charged £900 and £700 respectively, she drove, for awhile, a
thriving trade; but at last Colonel Wardle brought the scandal before

 Francis, Lord Jeffrey, a Scotch Judge, chiefly remembered
on account of his long connection with, and numerous contributions
to <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>, (the “Blue and Buff”)
of which he was one of the founders. In an article in that
Review (July, 1806) he denounced Tom Moore as “the
most licentious of modern versifiers, and the most poetical of
the propagators of impiety.” On this charge, which was too
true to be answered in any other way, Moore challenged
Jeffrey to fight a duel, and the two met at Chalk Farm, then
a favourite spot with duellists. The proceedings were stopped
by the interference of the police, when it was found that in
loading the pistols, the bullets had been carefully omitted.
This circumstance became the talk of the town, and Moore,
especially, was subjected to much ridicule. Byron thus
alludes to the <span class="lock">duel:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="footnote">When Moore read these lines he was so incensed that he
addressed a challenge to Lord Byron, but by cautiously confiding
it to a discreet friend it somehow never reached its destination.
Moore afterwards became very intimate with

 This would seem to show that poet and prophet are
synonymous, the noble bard having afterwards returned
to England, and again quitted it, under domestic circumstances
painfully notorious. His good-humoured forgiveness
of the Authors has already been alluded to in the
preface. Nothing of this illustrious poet, however trivial,
can be otherwise than interesting. “We knew him well.”
At Mr. Murray’s dinner-table the annotator met him and
Sir John Malcolm, Lord Byron talked of intending to
travel in Persia. “What must I do when I set off?” said
he to Sir John. “Cut off your buttons!” “My buttons!
what, these metal ones?” “Yes; the Persians are in the
main very honest fellows; but if you go thus bedizened,
you will infallibly be murdered for your buttons! “At a
dinner at Monk Lewis’s chambers in the Albany, Lord
Byron expressed to the writer his determination not to go
there again, adding, “I never will dine with a middle-aged
man who fills up his table with young ensigns, and has
looking-glass panels to his book-cases.” Lord Byron,
when one of the Drury-lane Committee of Management,
challenged the writer to sing alternately (like the swains
in Virgil) the praises of Mrs. Mardyn, the actress, who,
by-the-bye, was hissed off the stage for an imputed intimacy
of which she was quite innocent.</p>

<p class="footnote">The contest ran as follows:</p>

<div class="fnpoem">
<div class="i1">“Wake muse of fire, your ardent lyre,</div>
<div class="i2">Pour forth your amorous ditty,</div>
<div class="i1">But first profound, in duty bound,</div>

<div class="i2">So I must e’en swim solus.</div>
<div class="i1">‘Out, out, alas!’ ill-fated gas,</div>

<p class="footnote">And so on. The reader has, no doubt, already discovered
“which is the justice, and which is the thief.”</p>

<p class="footnote">Lord Byron at that time wore a very narrow cravat of
white sarsnet, with the shirt-collar falling over it; a black
coat and waistcoat, and very broad white trousers, to hide his
lame foot. These were of Russia duck in the morning, and
jean in the evening. His watch-chain had a number of small
gold seals appended to it, and was looped up to a button of his
waistcoat. His face was void of colour; he wore no whiskers.
His eyes were gray, fringed with long black lashes; and his
air was imposing, but rather supercilious. He undervalued
David Hume: denying his claim to genius on account of his
bulk, and calling him, from the Heroic epistle,</p>

<p class="footnote center">“The fattest hog in Epicurus’ sty.”</p>

<p class="footnote">One of this extraordinary man’s allegations was, that “fat
is an oily dropsy.” To stave off its visitation, he frequently
chewed tobacco in lieu of dinner, alleging that it absorbed the
gastric juice of the stomach, and prevented hunger. “Pass
your hand down my side,” said his lordship to the writer;
“can you count my ribs?” “Every one of them.” “I
am delighted to hear you say so. I called last week on
Lady &mdash;&mdash;; ‘Ah, Lord Byron,’ said she, ‘how fat you grow!’
But you know Lady &mdash;&mdash; is fond of saying spiteful things!”
Let this gossip be summed up with the words of Lord
Chesterfield, in his character of Bolingbroke: “Upon the
whole, on a survey of this extraordinary character, what can
we say, but ‘Alas, poor human nature!’”</p>

<p class="footnote">His favourite Pope’s description of man is applicable to
Byron <span class="lock">individually:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="fnpoem">
<div class="i1">“Chaos of thought and passion all confused,</div>
<div class="i1">Still by himself abused or disabused:</div>
<div class="i1">Created part to rise and part to fall,</div>
<div class="i1">Great lord of all things, yet a slave to all:</div>
<div class="i1">Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The glory, jest, and riddle of the world.”</div>
</div><!--end footnote poem-->

<p class="footnote">The writer never heard him allude to his deformed foot
except upon one occasion, when, entering the green-room of
Drury-lane, be found Lord Byron alone, the younger Byrne
and Miss Smith the dancer having just left him, after an
angry conference about a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</i>. “Had you been here a
minute sooner,” said Lord B., “you would have heard a
question about dancing referred to me:&mdash;me! (looking
mournfully downward) whom fate from my birth has prohibited
from taking a single step.”</p>

 “Holland’s edifice.” The late theatre was built by
Holland the architect. The writer visited it on the night of
its opening. The performances were <cite>Macbeth</cite> and the <cite>Virgin
Unmasked</cite>. Between the play and the farce, an excellent
epilogue, written by George Colman, was excellently spoken
by Miss Farren. It referred to the iron curtain which was,
in the event of fire, to be let down between the stage and the
audience, and which accordingly descended, by way of experiment,
leaving Miss Farren between the lamps and the
curtain. The fair speaker informed the audience, that should
the fire break out on the stage (where it usually originates), it
would thus be kept from the spectators; adding, with great
solemnity&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote">The theatre fell a victim to the flames within fifteen years
from the prognostic! These preparations against fire always
presuppose presence of mind and promptness in those who
are to put them into action. They remind one of the dialogue
in Morton’s <cite>Speed the Plough</cite>, between Sir Able Handy
and his son Bob:</p>

 In October 1856, the Chinese captured 12 of the crew of the Lorcha
<cite>Arrow</cite> in Canton river, on the plea that they were pirates. Commissioner
Yeh, the Chinese commander, released the prisoners but refused to
apologise for the outrage, thereupon Canton was bombarded and other
acts of war committed. In March 1857 the House of Commons, by a
majority of 19, censured Sir John Bowring, Governor of Hong Kong, for
the “violent measures” he had pursued. The Ministry (who took his

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
